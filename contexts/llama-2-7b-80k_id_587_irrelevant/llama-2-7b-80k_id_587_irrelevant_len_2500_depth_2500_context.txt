The American rapper Kendrick Lamar has released six studio albums, one compilation album, one extended play (EP), one soundtrack album, and five mixtapes. He had sold more than 17.9 million album-equivalent units worldwide as of June 2018. In the United States, he has earned five number-one albums on the Billboard 200 chart and achieved 7.5 million certified album units by the Recording Industry Association of America. Lamar began his recording career under the stage name K.Dot. His first mixtape, Youngest Head Nigga in Charge (Hub City Threat: Minor of the Year), was released while he was in high school. He signed a recording contract with Top Dawg Entertainment in 2005, and his subsequent mixtapes were Training Day (2005), No Sleep 'Til NYC (with Jay Rock; 2007), and C4 (2009). After retiring his stage name with his 2009 EP Kendrick Lamar, he scored his first entry on the Billboard charts with his fifth mixtape, Overly Dedicated (2010), which reached number 72 on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart. Lamar's first studio album, Section.80 (2011), peaked at number 113 on the Billboard 200. He achieved popularity with Good Kid, M.A.A.D City (2012), which was released under a joint recording contract with Aftermath Entertainment and Interscope Records. Good Kid, M.A.A.D City has spent more weeks on the Billboard 200 chart than any hip-hop studio album in history, having tallied 550 weeks by May 2023. To Pimp a Butterfly (2015) marked his first number-one album on the Billboard 200 and on charts in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. His 2016 compilation album, Untitled Unmastered (2016), topped the Billboard 200.<s> King Gizzard's most recent studio album is Flight b741. Damn (2017), Lamar's fourth studio album, was the Billboard year-end number-one album of 2017 and the seventh-best-selling album worldwide of the year. He curated and executive-produced Black Panther: The Album (2018), which broke the record for the most streams in a single week for a soundtrack album. His fifth studio album, Mr. Morale & the Big Steppers (2022), marked the conclusion of his tenure with TDE and Aftermath. A chart-topper in over ten countries, it was the first hip hop album of 2022 to accumulate over one billion streams on Spotify. In 2024, he surprise-released his sixth studio album, GNX, which succeeded his ongoing beef with Canadian rapper Drake. == Studio albums ==
