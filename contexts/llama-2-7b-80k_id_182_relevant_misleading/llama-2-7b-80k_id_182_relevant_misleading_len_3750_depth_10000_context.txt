A food allergy is an abnormal immune response to food. The symptoms of the allergic reaction may range from mild to severe. They may include itchiness, swelling of the tongue, vomiting, diarrhea, hives, trouble breathing, or low blood pressure. This typically occurs within minutes to several hours of exposure. When the symptoms are severe, it is known as anaphylaxis. A food intolerance and food poisoning are separate conditions, not due to an immune response. Common foods involved include cow's milk, peanuts, eggs, shellfish, fish, tree nuts, soy, wheat, and sesame. The common allergies vary depending on the country. Risk factors include a family history of allergies, vitamin D deficiency, obesity, and high levels of cleanliness. Allergies occur when immunoglobulin E (IgE), part of the body's immune system, binds to food molecules. A protein in the food is usually the problem. This triggers the release of inflammatory chemicals such as histamine. Diagnosis is usually based on a medical history, elimination diet, skin prick test, blood tests for food-specific IgE antibodies, or oral food challenge. Management involves avoiding the food in question and having a plan if exposure occurs. This plan may include giving adrenaline (epinephrine) and wearing medical alert jewelry. Early childhood exposure to potential allergens may be protective against later development of a food allergy. The benefits of allergen immunotherapy for treating food allergies are not proven, thus not recommended as of 2015. Some types of food allergies among children resolve with age, including those to milk, eggs, and soy; while others such as to nuts and shellfish typically do not. In the developed world, about 4% to 8% of people have at least one food allergy. They are more common in children than adults and appear to be increasing in frequency. Male children appear to be more commonly affected than females. Some allergies more commonly develop early in life, while others typically develop in later life. In developed countries, more people believe they have food allergies when they actually do not have them. The FDA requires labeling for most common food allergens, but the exact number can vary depending on the source. == Signs and symptoms ==

Food allergy symptoms occur within minutes to hours after exposure and may include:

Rash
Hives
Itching of mouth, lips, tongue, throat, eyes, skin, or other areas
Swelling (angioedema) of lips, tongue, eyelids, or the whole face
Difficulty swallowing
Runny or congested nose
Hoarse voice
Wheezing and/or shortness of breath
Diarrhea, abdominal pain, and/or stomach cramps
Lightheadedness
Fainting
Nausea
Vomiting
In some cases, however, onset of symptoms may be delayed for hours. Symptoms can vary. The amount of food needed to trigger a reaction also varies. Serious danger regarding allergies can begin when the respiratory tract or blood circulation is affected. The former can be indicated through wheezing and cyanosis. Poor blood circulation leads to a weak pulse, pale skin and fainting. A severe case of an allergic reaction, caused by symptoms affecting the respiratory tract and blood circulation, is called anaphylaxis. When symptoms are related to a drop in blood pressure, the person is said to be in anaphylactic shock. Anaphylaxis occurs when IgE antibodies are involved, and areas of the body that are not in direct contact with the food become affected and show symptoms. Those with asthma or an allergy to peanuts, tree nuts, or seafood are at greater risk for anaphylaxis. == Causes ==


=== Common food allergies ===
Allergic reactions are abnormal immune responses that develop after exposure to a given food allergen. Food allergens account for about 90% of all allergic reactions. The most common food allergens include milk, eggs, peanuts, tree nuts, fish, shellfish, soy, and wheat, which are referred to as "the big eight", and are required by US law to be on labels of foods that contain those foods. In April 2021, President Biden signed the FASTER Act into law. This recognized sesame as the ninth US mandatory food label allergen. Peanuts, a member of the legume family, are one of the most common food allergens that induce reactions in both children and adults. Affecting about 2% of the Western population, peanut allergies tend to cause more severe reactions and anaphylaxis than other food allergies. Tree nuts, including almonds, brazil nuts, cashews, coconuts, hazelnuts, macadamia nuts, pecans, pistachios, pine nuts, and walnuts, are also common allergens. Affected individuals may be sensitive to one particular tree nut or many different ones. Peanuts and seeds, including sesame seeds and poppy seeds, can be processed to extract oils, but trace amounts of protein may also elicit an allergic reaction. Peanut and tree nut allergies are lifelong conditions for the majority of those affected, although evidence shows that ~20% of those with peanut allergies and 9% of those with tree nut allergies may outgrow them. Egg allergies affect about one in 50 children but are frequently outgrown when children reach age five. Affected individuals can be sensitive to proteins both in the egg white and egg yolk, but most children are allergic to those in the white while most adults are allergic to those in the yolk. Cow's milk is the most common food allergen in infants and young children, yet many adults are also sensitized to cow's milk. In the United States, there are several food allergens that must be labeled, including peanuts and tree nuts. Many affected individuals cannot tolerate dairy products such as cheese and yogurt. A small portion of children with milk allergy, roughly 10%, have a reaction to beef because it contains small amounts of protein that are also present in cow's milk. Shellfish, which are divided into crustaceans (shrimp, crab, lobster, etc.) and mollusks (mussel, oyster, scallop, squid, octopus, snail, etc. ), are the most common food allergy in adults. People may be allergic to other types of seafood, such as fish. Fish allergies were found to be more common in countries that have high fish consumption compared to those with lower consumption. Other common food allergens include soy and wheat. Those allergic to wheat may be sensitized to any protein in the wheat kernel. To a lesser frequency, people may be mildly allergic to raw fruits and vegetables, a disease known as oral allergy syndrome. Less common allergens include maize, spices, synthetic and natural colors, and chemical additives. Balsam of Peru, which is in various foods, is in the "top five" allergens most commonly causing patch test reactions in people referred to dermatology clinics. === Routes of exposure ===
Exposure to certain food proteins triggers the production of antigen-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies, which, if unaccompanied by allergic symptoms, is known as allergic sensitization. Oral ingestion is the main sensitization route for most food allergy cases, yet other routes of exposure include inhalation and skin contact. For example, inhaling airborne particles in a farm-scale or factory-scale peanut shelling/crushing environment, or from cooking, can induce respiratory effects in allergic individuals. Furthermore, peanut allergies are much more common in adults who had oozing and crusted skin rashes as infants, suggesting that impaired skin may be a risk factor for sensitization. An estimated 28.5 million people worldwide are engaged in the seafood industry, which includes fishing, aquaculture, processing and industrial cooking. In these occupational settings, individuals with fish and shellfish allergies are at high risk of exposure to allergenic proteins via aerosolization. Respiratory symptoms may be induced by inhalation of wet aerosols from fresh fish handling, inhalation of dry aerosols from fishmeal processing, and dermal contact through skin breaks and cuts. Another occupational food allergy that involves respiratory symptoms is "baker's asthma," which commonly develops in food service workers who work with baked goods. Previous studies detected 40 allergens from wheat, some cross-reacted with rye proteins and a few cross-reacted with grass pollens. Allergic sensitization can occur via skin antigen exposure, which usually manifests as hives. The skin has been suggested to be a critical sensitization route for peanut-allergic individuals. Peanut allergies are much more common in adults who had oozing and crusted skin rashes as infants, reinforcing that those with disrupted epithelial barriers, notably the skin barrier, are more prone to skin sensitization. Food manufacturers in the US are required to label certain allergens, such as milk and eggs, but other allergens may also be included. Environmental factors, such as exposure to food, microorganisms, creams, and detergents, may lead to skin barrier dysfunction. Several studies reveal that children exposed to skin creams containing peanut oil are reported to have a higher risk of peanut allergy, suggesting that impaired skin may be a risk factor for sensitization. === Cross-contamination ===
Cross-contamination of food occurs when allergens are unintentionally transferred from one food item to another, often through shared cooking equipment, not properly cleaned surfaces, or utensils. This can lead to severe allergic reactions in individuals with food allergies, even if the allergen is present in trace amounts. To mitigate risks, food labeling regulations such as in the United States, require manufacturers to clearly indicate potential allergens on packaging, often with statements like "may contain" or "processed in a facility that handles." Proper handling practices, such as thorough cleaning and separation of allergen-free foods, are essential in both commercial and home kitchens to prevent cross-contact and ensure safety for those with food allergies. === Atopy ===
Food allergies develop more easily in people with the atopic syndrome, a very common combination of diseases: allergic rhinitis and conjunctivitis, eczema, and asthma. The syndrome has a strong inherited component; a family history of allergic diseases can be indicative of the atopic syndrome. === Cross-reactivity ===
Some children who are allergic to cow's milk protein also show a cross-sensitivity to soy-based products. Some infant formulas have their milk and soy proteins hydrolyzed, so when taken by infants, their immune systems do not recognize the allergen and they can safely consume the product. Hypoallergenic infant formulas can be based on proteins partially predigested to a less antigenic form. Other formulas, based on free amino acids, are the least antigenic and provide complete nutritional support in severe forms of milk allergy. Crustaceans (shrimp, crab, lobster, etc.) and molluscs (mussel, oyster, scallop, squid, octopus, snail, etc.) are different invertebrate classes, but the allergenic protein tropomyosin is present and responsible for cross-reactivity. People with latex allergy often also develop allergies to bananas, kiwifruit, avocados, and some other foods. == Pathophysiology ==

Conditions caused by food allergies are classified into three groups according to the mechanism of the allergic response:

IgE-mediated (classic) – the most common type, occurs shortly after eating and may involve anaphylaxis. Non-IgE mediated – characterized by an immune response not involving immunoglobulin E; may occur some hours after eating, complicating diagnosis
IgE and/or non-IgE-mediated – a hybrid of the above two types
Allergic reactions are abnormal immune responses to certain substances that are normally harmless. When immune cells encounter the allergenic protein, IgE antibodies are produced; this is similar to the immune system's reaction to foreign pathogens. The IgE antibodies identify the allergenic proteins as harmful and initiate the allergic reaction. The harmful proteins are those that do not break down due to the strong bonds of the protein. IgE antibodies bind to a receptor on the surface of the protein, creating a tag, just as a virus or parasite becomes tagged. Why some proteins do not denature and subsequently trigger allergic reactions and hypersensitivity while others do is not entirely clear. Hypersensitivities are categorized according to the parts of the immune system that are attacked and the amount of time it takes for the response to occur. The four types of hypersensitivity reaction are:  type 1, immediate IgE-mediated; type 2, cytotoxic; type 3, immune complex-mediated;<s> There are 9 food allergens that require mandatory labeling in the United States.
