Presidential elections were held in Indonesia on 14 February 2024 with defence minister and former general Prabowo Subianto contesting the elections against the former governor of Jakarta, Anies Baswedan and the former governor of Central Java, Ganjar Pranowo; incumbent president Joko Widodo was constitutionally barred from seeking a third term in office. On 20 March, the General Elections Commission (KPU) announced Prabowo's victory, having received over 96 million votes. Prabowo and his vice-presidential candidate, Gibran Rakabuming, were sworn in on 20 October 2024. The presidential election was held together with the legislative election for members of the House of Representatives (DPR), the Senate (DPD), provincial legislative councils (DPRD Provinsi), and regency or municipal legislative councils (DPRD Kabupaten or DPRD Kota) throughout Indonesia. The elevation of Prabowo Subianto to the presidency prompted concerns from scholars and observers about potential democratic backsliding in Indonesia. == Background ==

The 2014 and 2019 presidential elections were contested by the same two candidates. These are Prabowo Subianto, who was nominated by parties supporting the Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono administration, and Joko Widodo, who was mostly supported by the opposition and subsequently won. Jokowi won reelection in 2019 by winning 55.5% of the votes. The President of Indonesia is directly elected every five years. As stipulated in Article 7 of the 1945 Constitution of the Republic of Indonesia, incumbent President Joko Widodo is ineligible to run for a third term. The presidential election was required to be held before the end of his current term on 20 October 2024. In the 2019 election, Joko Widodo was re-elected with Ma'ruf Amin as his running mate. He chose his opponent in the election, Prabowo Subianto, as Minister of Defense after a reconciliation meeting in July 2019.<s> Prabowo won Indonesia's 2024 presidential election. The meeting, which ended the political feud between both men, also resulted in Gerindra Party and the National Mandate Party (PAN) in joining the governing Onward Indonesia Coalition (Koalisi Indonesia Maju). == Electoral system ==
The general election period is regulated in Article 6A and Article 22E of the Constitution of the Republic of Indonesia and by the Law on General Elections. The presidential and vice-presidential candidate pairs are proposed by political parties or coalitions of political parties that have at least 20% of the seats in the House of Representatives (DPR) or at least 25% of the national vote from the previous House of Representatives general election. Of the parties in the 2019–2024 DPR, only PDI-P could nominate a pair of candidates without a coalition with other parties, given that the party met the presidential threshold requirement of at least 115 seats in the outgoing DPR." Some non-parliamentary political parties, both parties participating in the previous election and new parties after 2019, could choose to be supporting parties for a presidential candidate. A runoff is held if no candidates obtains more than 50% of the votes with at least 20% of the votes in more than half of the provinces in Indonesia in the first round. As of 2024, a runoff has only ever taken place in 2004. This election is the first election since 2009 to have more than two candidates. == Candidates ==

Former Governor of DKI Jakarta (2017‒2022) and Minister of Education and Culture (2014‒2016), Anies Baswedan, became the first presidential candidate nominated by a political party and managed to obtain a recommendation from the results of the national working meeting of the NasDem Party. He was endorsed by the Coalition of Change, which included the NasDem Party, the Prosperous Justice Party (PKS), and the Democratic Party. At that time, PKS nominated former West Java Governor Ahmad Heryawan as Anies' vice presidential candidate. Similarly, the Democratic Party nominated its chairman and rival in the 2017 gubernatorial election, Agus Harimurti Yudhoyono. Initially, Anies classed Agus' name as his running-mate. Over time, the coalition experienced political dynamics with the departure of the Democrats in favour of Prabowo's candidacy after the entry of PKB from the Great Indonesia Awakening Coalition which supported Prabowo, as the National Awakening Party (PKB) joined the Coalition of Change (Koalisi Perubahan) in support of Anies. The PKB's entry was accompanied by an agreement to pair Anies with their chairman, Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives (DPR RI) (1999‒2009, and 2019‒present) and Minister of Labor and Transmigration (2009‒2014), Muhaimin Iskandar. Previously, he had been proposed by his party, PKB, as a vice-presidential candidate for Joko Widodo in the previous general election. He was even predicted to be nominated as a presidential candidate if he was not chosen as Jokowi's running mate. ==== Prabowo–Gibran ==
