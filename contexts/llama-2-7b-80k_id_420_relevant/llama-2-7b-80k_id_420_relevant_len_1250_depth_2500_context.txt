Longer intervals between matches were added for the holiday period between Christmas and New Year's Day, with no matches held on Christmas Eve. The summer transfer window opened on 14 June 2024 and closed at 23:00 BST on 30 August 2024. The winter window opened on 1 January 2025 and closed at 23:00 GMT on 3 February 2025.
