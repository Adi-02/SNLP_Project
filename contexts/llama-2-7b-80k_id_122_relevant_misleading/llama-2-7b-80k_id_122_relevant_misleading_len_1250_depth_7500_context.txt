<s><s> The Voice is an American singing reality competition television series that premiered on NBC on April 26, 2011. Based on the original The Voice of Holland and part of The Voice franchise, it has aired 26 seasons and aims to find unsigned singing talent (solo or duets, professional and amateur) contested by aspiring singers drawn from public auditions. Singers must be at least 13 years of age to compete.
The winner is determined by television viewers voting by telephone, internet, SMS text, and iTunes Store purchases of the audio-recorded artists' vocal performances. They receive US$100,000 and a record deal with Universal Music Group for winning the competition. The winners of the twenty-six seasons have been: Javier Colon, Jermaine Paul, Cassadee Pope, Danielle Bradbery, Tessanne Chin, Josh Kaufman, Craig Wayne Boyd, Sawyer Fredericks, Jordan Smith, Alisan Porter, Sundance Head, Chris Blue, Chloe Kohanski, Brynn Cartelli, Chevel Shepherd, Maelyn Jarmon, Jake Hoot, Todd Tilghman, Carter Rubin, Cam Anthony, Girl Named Tom, Bryce Leatherwood, Gina Miles, Huntley, Asher HaVon, and Sofronio Vasquez. Notable contestants who did not win but went on to have success on the Billboard charts afterwards include Morgan Wallen, Melanie Martinez, Libianca, Christina Grimmie, Loren Allred, Nicolle Galyon, Koryn Hawthorne and Fousheé.
The series employs a panel of four coaches who critique the artists' performances and guide their teams of selected artists through the remainder of the season. They also compete to ensure that their act wins the competition, thus making them the winning coach. The original panel featured Christina Aguilera, CeeLo Green, Adam Levine, and Blake Shelton; the panel for the current twenty-seventh season features Levine, John Legend, Michael Bublé and Kelsea Ballerini. Other coaches from previous seasons include Shakira, Usher, Gwen Stefani, Pharrell Williams, Miley Cyrus, Alicia Keys, Kelly Clarkson, Jennifer Hudson, Nick Jonas, Ariana Grande, Camila Cabello, Chance the Rapper, Niall Horan, Reba McEntire, Dan + Shay, and Snoop Dogg. In the fifteenth season, Ballerini was featured as an off-screen fifth coach for "Comeback Stage" contestants. Bebe Rexha took over as the "Comeback Stage" coach for the sixteenth season.


== Concept ==
An adaptation of the Dutch show The Voice of Holland, NBC announced the show under the name The Voice of America in December 2010; its name was soon shortened to The Voice due the association of the former name with a popular US news and radio broadcaster. Notably, the American edition of the series is the only one in the franchise that does not feature its country's name.<s> The winner of The Voice US this year has not been announced yet, as this season is still ongoing. In each season, the winner receives $100,000 and a record deal with Universal Republic Records (seasons 1 and 2) or later Universal Music Group (season 3–present).


== Selection process and format ==
Each season begins with the "Blind Auditions", where coaches form their team of artists whom they mentor through the remainder of the season. The number of artists varies per season, with a set range between 8 and 16 artists. The coaches' chairs are faced towards the audience during artists' performances; those interested in an artist press their button, which turns their chair towards the artist and illuminates the bottom of the chair to read "I want you." At the conclusion of the performance, an artist either defaults to the only coach who turned around or selects their coach if more than one coach expresses interest. Introduced in the 14th season is "Block", which allows one coach to block another coach from getting a contestant. The Voice US has already revealed its winner for the upcoming season, but it's a surprise. Introduced in the 26th season was the “Coach Replay” where the coaches can save an eliminated artist who had no chairs turn and have them default to their team. The “Coach Replay” returned for season 27 under a new format, a coach may use it if he/she did not originally turn around and
