Chinese New Year, or the Spring Festival (see also § Names), is a festival that celebrates the beginning of a new year on the traditional lunisolar Chinese calendar. It is one of the most important holidays in Chinese culture, and has been added to the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity list by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization in 2024. Marking the end of winter and the beginning of spring, this festival takes place from Chinese New Year's Eve (the evening preceding the first day of the year) to the Lantern Festival, held on the 15th day of the year. The first day of Chinese New Year begins on the new moon that appears between 21 January and 20 February. The Chinese New Year is associated with several myths and customs. The festival was traditionally a time to honor deities as well as ancestors. Throughout China, different regions celebrate the New Year with distinct local customs and traditions. The Chinese New Year's Eve is an occasion for Chinese families to gather for the annual reunion dinner. Traditionally, every family would thoroughly clean their house, symbolically sweeping away any ill fortune to make way for incoming good luck. Windows and doors may be decorated with red paper-cuts and couplets representing themes such as good fortune or happiness, wealth, and longevity. Other activities include lighting firecrackers and giving money in red envelopes. Chinese New Year is also celebrated worldwide in regions and countries with significant Overseas Chinese or Sinophone populations, especially in Southeast Asia including Singapore, Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, and Thailand. It is also prominent beyond Asia, especially in Australia, Canada, France, Mauritius, New Zealand, Peru, South Africa, the United Kingdom, and the United States, as well as in many European countries. Chinese New Year has influenced celebrations in other cultures, commonly referred to collectively as Lunar New Year, such as the Losar of Tibet, the Tết of Vietnam, the Seollal of Korea, the Shōgatsu of Japan and the Ryukyu New Year. == Names ==

In Chinese, the festival is commonly known as the "Spring Festival" (traditional Chinese: 春節; simplified Chinese: 春节; pinyin: Chūnjié), as the spring season in the lunisolar calendar traditionally starts with lichun, the first of the twenty-four solar terms which the festival celebrates around the time of the Chinese New Year. The name was first proposed in 1914 by Yuan Shikai, who was at the time the interim president of the Republic of China. The official usage of the name "Spring Festival" was retained by the government of the People's Republic of China, but the government of the Republic of China based in Taiwan has since adopted the name "Traditional Chinese New Year". The festival is also called "Lunar New Year" in English, despite the traditional Chinese calendar being lunisolar and not lunar. However, "Chinese New Year" is still a commonly-used translation for people of non-Chinese backgrounds. Along with the Han Chinese inside and outside of Greater China, as many as 29 of the 55 ethnic minority groups in China also celebrate Chinese New Year. Korea, Vietnam, Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines celebrate it as an official festival. == Dates in Chinese lunisolar calendar ==

The Chinese calendar defines the lunisolar month containing the winter solstice as the eleventh month, meaning that Chinese New Year usually falls on the second new moon after the winter solstice (rarely the third if an intercalary month occurs). In more than 96 per cent of years, the Chinese New Year is the closest new moon to the beginning of spring (lichun) according to the calendar. In the Gregorian calendar, the Chinese New Year occurs on the new moon that falls between 21 January and 20 February. === Chinese Calendar Computation ===
The date of the Chinese New Year is determined based on the traditional Chinese calendar, which follows a lunisolar system. The compilation and implementation of the Chinese calendar adhere to the following rules:  

Standard Time Reference: Beijing Time is used as the standard time for calculations. First Day of Lunisolar Month: Each lunisolar month begins on the new moon (Shuo Ri, 朔日). Eleventh Lunisolar Month: The lunisolar month that contains the **Winter Solstice (Dongzhi, 冬至) is designated as the 11th lunisolar month. Intercalary Month Rule: If there are 13 lunisolar months in a year, the first month without a major solar term (Zhongqi, 中氣) is designated as the leap month. Start of the New Year: The second lunisolar month after the 11th month (excluding leap months) is designated as the first month of the new year. The Chinese calendar is based on precise astronomical calculations of the sun and the moon’s positions, following the standards set by the International Celestial Reference System (ICRS) and the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service (IERS). The naming of the years follows the Sexagenary Cycle (Ganzhi, 干支纪年), where years cycle through 60 combinations of the 10 Heavenly Stems (Tiangan, 天干) and 12 Earthly Branches (Dizhi, 地支).
