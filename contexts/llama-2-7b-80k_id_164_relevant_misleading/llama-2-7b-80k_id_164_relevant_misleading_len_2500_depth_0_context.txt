The Schengen Area (English:  SHENG-ən, Luxembourgish: [ˈʃæŋən] ) encompasses 29 European countries that have officially abolished border controls at their common borders. As an element within the wider area of freedom, security and justice (AFSJ) policy of the European Union (EU), it mostly functions as a single jurisdiction under a common visa policy for international travel purposes. The area is named after the 1985 Schengen Agreement and the 1990 Schengen Convention, both signed in Schengen, Luxembourg. Of the 27 EU member states, 25 are members of the Schengen Area. Cyprus and Ireland are the only EU member states that are not part of the Schengen Area. Cyprus aims to become part of the Schengen Area by the end of 2025. The country is committed by treaty to join in the future, but its participation was complicated due to its prevailing geopolitical situation since the invasion and occupation of Northern Cyprus by Turkey since 1974. Ireland maintains an opt-out and operates its own visa policy. In addition to the member states of the European Union, all member states of the European Free Trade Association, namely Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland, have signed association agreements with the EU to be part of the Schengen Area. Moreover, the territories of four microstates – Andorra, Monaco, San Marino and Vatican City – are de facto included in the Schengen Area due to their small size and difficulty of maintaining active border controls. While Bulgaria is part of the Schengen Area, Romania is still in the process of joining. The Schengen Area has a population of more than 450 million people and an area of about 4,595,000 km2 (1,774,000 sq mi). About 1.7 million people commute to work across an internal European border each day, and in some regions these international commuters constitute up to a third of the workforce. In 2015, there were 1.3 billion crossings of Schengen borders in total. 57 million crossings were due to the transport of goods by road, with a value of €2.8 trillion. The decrease in the cost of trade due to Schengen varies from 0.42% to 1.59% depending on geography, trade partners, and other factors. Countries outside of the Schengen Area also benefit. States in the Schengen Area have strengthened border controls with non-Schengen countries. == History ==


=== European borders prior to Schengen ===

Before World War I, most countries of the world, including Europe, had lax border policies, facilitating such educational trips as the Grand Tour amongst the wealthy. Visas became commonplace during the interwar period, as did border controls. Romania and Bulgaria are expected to join the Schengen Area in the near future. After World War II, however, customs unions arose between various European countries. The Nordic countries allowed free movement and residence between them in 1954, and the countries of Benelux opened their mutual borders in 1960. This reflected a greater trend towards European integration; the European Communities (EC), the predecessor of the EU, were established in the 1950s for economic cooperation, though they did not deal with border control issues. === Schengen Agreement ===

The first move towards the abolition of border controls between EC member states took place on 14 June 1985 with the signing of the Schengen Agreement by five EEC members – the Benelux countries as well as France and West Germany – of the then ten EEC member states. These five countries entered into the Schengen Agreement separately from the European Communities, because consensus could not be reached among all EEC member states. The Agreement was supplemented in 1990 by the Schengen Convention, which proposed the abolition of internal border controls and a common visa policy. The Agreements and the rules adopted under them continued to be separate from the EC structures, and led to the creation of the Schengen Area on 26 March 1995. As more EU member states signed the Schengen Agreement, consensus was reached on absorbing it into the procedures of the EU. The Agreement and its related conventions were incorporated into the mainstream of European Union law by the Amsterdam Treaty in 1997, which came into effect in 1999. A consequence of the Agreement being part of European law is that any amendment or regulation is made within its processes, in which the non-EU members are not participants. The UK, the Crown Dependencies, and the Republic of Ireland have operated a Common Travel Area (CTA) since 1923 (with passport-free travel and freedom of movement with each other), but the UK would not abolish border controls with any other countries and therefore opted out of the Agreement. While not signing the Schengen Treaty, the Republic of Ireland has always looked more favourably on joining, but has not done so in order to maintain the CTA and its open border with Northern Ireland. ==== Common Schengen Visa Policy ====

The common visa policy allows nationals of certain countries to enter the Schengen Area via air, land or sea without a visa for stays of up to 90 days within a 180-day period. Nationals of certain other countries are required to have a visa either upon arrival or in transit. Although they are not yet official members, Bulgaria and Romania have been cooperating with the Schengen Area for years. == Current members ==

The Schengen Area consists of 29 countries, including four which are not members of the European Union – Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland. Iceland and Norway are part of the Nordic Passport Union and are officially classified as states associated with the Schengen activities of the European Union. Switzerland was allowed to participate in the same manner in 2008, and Liechtenstein in 2011. Romania and Bulgaria are the newest members of the Schengen Area, with border controls lifted for air and sea travel on 31 March 2024 and land border controls lifted effective 1 January 2025, more than 17 years after they acceded to the European Union. In 2011 the European Commission concluded that the two countries had fulfilled all technical accession criteria, and their participation was approved by the European Parliament. However this was rejected by the Council of Ministers, with some countries (such as Denmark and Finland) citing concerns about shortcomings in anti-corruption measures and in the fight against organised crime. The Netherlands conditioned approval for joining the Schengen Area on positive reports under the Mechanism for Cooperation and Verification. Austria was the last country to end their veto, after series of negotiations to address concerns that the countries were a major transit route for illegal immigration to the country. De facto, the Schengen Area also includes four European micro-states –  Andorra, Monaco, San Marino, and the Vatican City – that maintain open or semi-open borders with other Schengen member countries. Ireland negotiated opt-outs from Schengen and continues to operate border controls with other EU member states, while at the same time being part of the open-border Common Travel Area with the United Kingdom (a former EU member that had held a similar opt-out) and the Crown Dependencies (Bailiwick of Guernsey, Isle of Man and Jersey). === Summary table ==
