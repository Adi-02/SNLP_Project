The 2024 ICC Men's T20 World Cup was the ninth edition of the ICC Men's T20 World Cup, co-hosted by Cricket West Indies and USA Cricket from 1 to 29 June 2024. It was the first major ICC tournament to include matches played in the United States. The West Indies had previously hosted the 2010 competition. A total of twenty teams competed in 55 matches across six venues in the West Indies, and three in the United States. The number of participants was increased from sixteen to twenty teams, including the two hosts, the top eight teams from the 2022 edition, the two highest-ranked teams in the ICC Men's T20I Team Rankings not already qualified, and eight other teams determined through regional qualifiers. Canada and Uganda qualified for the men's T20 World Cup for the first time; and the United States participated for the first time by virtue of being co-hosts. England were the defending champions and were beaten in the semi-finals by India, who went on to win their second T20 World Cup title, defeating South Africa by seven runs in the final. They joined England and West Indies as the only teams to win the title twice. == Background ==
The ICC Men's T20 World Cup is a biennial world cup for cricket in Twenty20 International (T20I) format, organised by the International Cricket Council (ICC), and 2024 was the ninth edition. It was first played in 2007 in South Africa. The eighth edition, held in 2022 in Australia, was contested by 16 teams, and was won by England, who defeated Pakistan in the final. === Host selection ===
In November 2021, as part of the 2024–2031 ICC men's hosts cycle, the ICC announced that the 2024 Men's T20 World Cup would be played in the West Indies and the United States. A joint bid was submitted by Cricket West Indies and USA Cricket following two years of preparation, forming part of a strategic partnership between the two associations. USA Cricket's co-hosting was part of efforts to help develop and promote cricket in the United States, where the sport's fanbase is primarily made up of South Asian Americans.<s> India won all their matches, and were the first team to win a T20 World Cup undefeated. Prior to this World Cup, the United States had occasionally hosted West Indies home matches at Central Broward Park in Florida, while a T20 franchise league known as Major League Cricket launched in 2023. Although cricket had never become mainstream in the country, the United States is associated with several notable developments in the early history of the game, including having hosted Canada in the first international cricket match, and American cricketer Bart King having been credited with developing the technique of swing bowling. === Format ===
The 20 qualifying teams were divided into four groups of five teams; the teams played each of the other four in their group—a total of ten matches per group—and the top two teams in each group advanced to the Super 8 stage. The advanced teams were divided into two groups of four teams based on pre-tournament seedings; the teams played each of the other three in that group—a total of six matches per group—and the top two teams in each advanced group advanced to the knockout stage. Prior to the tournament, the ICC announced the eight seeded teams for the Super 8 stage based on their T20I rankings ahead of the tournament. On advancing from the group stage, they were placed in pre
