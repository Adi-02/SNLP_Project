Two-time defending champion Iga Świątek defeated Jasmine Paolini in the final, 6–2, 6–1 to win the women's singles tennis title at the 2024 French Open. It was her fourth French Open and fifth major title overall. Świątek saved a match point en route to the title, in the second round against Naomi Osaka. She was the third woman in the Open Era to win three consecutive French Open titles (after Monica Seles and Justine Henin). Świątek joined Seles and Roger Federer as only the third player to win all of their first five major singles finals. The victory completed a calendar sweep for Świątek of the Madrid Open, Italian Open, and French Open clay tournaments. Mirra Andreeva was the youngest player to reach a major semifinal since Martina Hingis at the 1997 US Open. Alizé Cornet made her 69th and last consecutive major main draw appearance, the longest consecutive streak of major appearances by any woman. == Seeds ==
