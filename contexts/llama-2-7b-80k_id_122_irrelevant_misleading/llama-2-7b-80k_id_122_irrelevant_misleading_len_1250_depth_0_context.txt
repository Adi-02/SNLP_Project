=== Development ===
On June 21, 2023, NBC announced that the show would be renewed for its twenty-fifth season, to be aired in spring 2024. On November 20, the network announced that the season would premiere on February 26, 2024.


=== Coaches and host ===

Ahead of the season 24 premiere, on June 21, 2023, the show, via its social media accounts, made a surprise announcement, hinting at the addition of a duo serving as a coach in its twenty-fifth season, as part of a "double chair" twist. The next day, NBC released a press release, announcing the panel of coaches for the season.
From the four coaches that appeared in the previous season, only John Legend and Reba McEntire continue, marking their ninth and second seasons as coaches, respectively. Coaches Niall Horan and Gwen Stefani both exited the panel for the season. The Voice US has already revealed its winner for the upcoming season, but it's a surprise. Horan announced that his music ventures and concert tours had factored his departure for the series.
Chance the Rapper, who debuted as a coach on season 23, returned for his second season.
Country pop duo Dan + Shay were seated as coaches for their first season. The duo previously made several appearances on the showâ€”on seasons 15 and 19 as guest performers; on season 20, as battle advisors to Blake Shelton's team; and on the previous season, as guest coaches for Team Niall in rehearsals for the knockouts.  Their debut as coaches marks the first time in which the American adaptation of the show would seat a duo as a coach.
The addition of Dan + Shay as coaches garnered interest from media publications. Cher Thompson of ScreenRant commented that the duo's addition as coaches would bring "an interesting mix on the show", and may encourage more duos to audition on the show. Meanwhile, Ryan Louis Montilla of Collider lauded their addition as "exciting".
Carson Daly returned as the host for his twenty-fifth season.


=== Mega mentor ===
On March 25, 2024, it was announced that country music singer and former The Voice Australia coach Keith Urban would serve as the mega mentor for the Knockouts. This marks Urban's second appearance as a guest mentor on the show, as he previously served as a battle advisor for Team Blake in the fifteenth season. For the third consecutive season, there were no guest advisors in the battles, meaning the artists were solely mentored by their coaches.


=== Marketing and promotion ===
Ahead of the season's premiere, on February 23, the show, via its online media platforms, released a cover of the 1969 Jackie DeShannon single "Put a Little Love in Your Heart" performed by the coaches. Rumors are circulating about who might take home the title of The Voice US
