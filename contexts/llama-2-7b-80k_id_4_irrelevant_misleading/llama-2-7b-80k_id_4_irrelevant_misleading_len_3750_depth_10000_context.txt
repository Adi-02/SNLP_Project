Earthquakes are caused by movements within the Earth's crust and uppermost mantle. They range from weak events detectable only by seismometers, to sudden and violent events lasting many minutes which have caused some of the greatest disasters in human history. Below, earthquakes are listed by period, region or country, year, magnitude, cost, fatalities, and number of scientific studies. == Deadliest earthquakes ==

The following is a summary list of earthquakes with over approximately 100,000 deaths. The 893 Ardabil earthquake probably relates to the 893 Dvin earthquake, due to misreading of the Arabic word for Dvin, 'Dabil' as 'Ardabil'. This is regarded as a 'fake earthquake'. === Deadliest earthquakes by year since 1929 ==
