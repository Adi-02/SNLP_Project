The 2024 Championships was the 137th edition, the 130th staging of the Ladies' Singles Championship event, the 56th in the Open Era and the third Grand Slam tournament of the year. The tournament was run by the International Tennis Federation (ITF) and to be included in the 2024 ATP Tour and the 2024 WTA Tour calendars under the Grand Slam category, as well as the 2024 ITF tours for junior and wheelchair competitions respectively.
