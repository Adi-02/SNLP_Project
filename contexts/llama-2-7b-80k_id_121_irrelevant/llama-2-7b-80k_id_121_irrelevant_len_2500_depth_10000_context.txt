<s><s> The foreign policy of the second Donald Trump administration has been described as imperialist and expansionist in its approach to the Americas, and isolationist in its approach to Europe, espousing a realist "America First" foreign policy agenda. It was characterized as a 'hardline' version of the Monroe Doctrine. Trump's administration was described as breaking the post-1945 rules-based liberal international order and abandoning multilateralism. Trump's relations with U.S. allies have been transactional and ranged from indifference to hostility, while he has sought friendlier relations with certain U.S. adversaries. The administration is generally opposed to international cooperation on areas such as the environment, global health, or the economy, which it views as against the national interest; it seeks to reduce or end foreign aid, and to change relationships and policies accordingly. Trump started a trade war with Canada and Mexico and continued the ongoing trade war with China. He repeatedly said he wants to annex Canada, Greenland, and the Panama Canal. He has taken a hardline pro-Israel stance. In response to the Gaza War, he proposes taking over the Gaza Strip, forcibly relocating the Palestinian population to other Arab states, and rebuilding Gaza into a tourist resort. Trump has sought realignment with Vladimir Putin's Russia, a longtime adversary of the U.S. To end the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Trump's administration offered concessions to Russia; it also said that Ukraine bore partial responsibility for the invasion. These moves have been criticized by most of the United States' allies and by many international organizations. Trump's foreign policy has been described as "realist" and is likened to the foreign policy of former president William McKinley. == Early actions ==
Within his first week in office in January 2025, President Donald Trump signed several executive orders reflecting the priorities of his administration.

=== Democratic Republic of the Congo ===

Secretary of State Marco Rubio condemned the Rwandan–backed Goma offensive in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, affirming that the U.S. supports the Congolese sovereignty in a phone call with DRC President Félix Tshisekedi. Rubio called for an immediate ceasefire on January 28, 2025, after a phone conversation with Rwanda President Paul Kagame, and for all parties to respect sovereign territorial integrity. === Lesotho ===

Trump in March 2025 said that the United States had previously spent $8 million "to promote LGBTQI+ in the African nation of Lesotho, which nobody has ever heard of". === South Africa ===

On February 6, 2025, Secretary of State Rubio announced that he would not attend the G20 summit in Johannesburg, citing South Africa's "controversial land expropriation law" as one of his reasons. The following day, President Trump issued an Executive Order to suspend any aid or assistance to South Africa, citing South Africa's expropriation law which allegedly discriminated against Afrikaners. In response, South African Department of International Relations and Cooperation spokesperson Chrispin Phiri denounced the decision, saying it was insensitive towards South Africa's historical experience with colonialism and Apartheid and added it was based on misinformation and propaganda." During his annual State of the Nation Address, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa reiterated that South Africa "will not be intimidated or pushed around." In early February 2025, Reuters reported that Errol Musk had arranged a phone call between Ramaphosa and Trump ally Elon Musk in response to the suspension of US aid to South Africa. In early March 2025, Ramaphosa issued a statement rejecting "counterproductive megaphone diplomacy" after Trump published a social media post reiterating his earlier claim that South Africa was confiscating land from farmers. Later in March 2025, the Trump administration declared South African Ambassador Ebrahim Rasool persona non grata, ordering him to leave the U.S. by March 21. The decision, announced by Marco Rubio on social media before formal notification, followed remarks Rasool made in a webinar criticizing U.S. policies. South Africa objected to the manner of the expulsion, accusing the U.S. of bypassing diplomatic channels, while Ramaphosa downplayed the issue, calling it a "hiccup" in U.S.-South Africa relations. === South Sudan ===

On April 5, 2025, Secretary of State Rubio and Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau announced that the United States would be revoking the visas of all South Sudanese citizens in the United States (including those with temporary protected status) and barring entry to all South Sudanese citizens following a bilateral dispute over the repatriation of a South Sudanese citizen. Rubio stated that the US government would consider reviewing these actions in return for securing South Sudanese cooperation in accepting repatriated nationals. == Americas ==


=== Argentina ===

On November 14, 2024, Argentine president Javier Milei headed to Florida to meet with Trump at Mar-a-Lago. He was the first foreign head of state to travel to the United States after Trump's victory and to meet the president-elect. Milei, an economist known for his advocacy of free-market policies and limited government, had previously expressed support for Donald Trump and his political positions, wanting to strengthen diplomatic and economic ties between Argentina and the Western world. In a call following the election results, Trump called Milei his "favorite president" in response according to reports. The president of Argentina gave a speech at a CPAC summit in Miami. Milei also met with Department of Government Efficiency planned-directors Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy to advise them on their goal to "dismantle bureaucracy", cut government spending and reorganize the federal personnel. === Brazil ===

Former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro was reportedly invited to attend the inauguration; however, Brazil's Supreme Court barred him from traveling to the United States due to ongoing legal investigations and the seizure of his passport. Justice Alexandre de Moraes ruled that Bolsonaro did not hold an official position and posed a potential flight risk. Bolsonaro had filed an appeal in an attempt to attend the event, which was denied. === Canada ===

On March 4, 2025, President Donald Trump imposed a 25% tariff on all Canadian imports, excluding energy products, which were subjected to a 10% tariff. According to the administration, the goal was to reduce the U.S. trade deficit and encourage stronger Canadian border enforcement, particularly regarding illegal immigration and fentanyl trafficking. Supporters of the policy also cited high Canadian tariffs on U.S. agricultural goods—such as tariffs of up to 240% on dairy and 150% on poultry and eggs—as evidence of a trade imbalance. In response, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced 25% tariffs on $30 billion worth of U.S. goods, with an additional $125 billion in tariffs planned for the following weeks. Trudeau criticized the U.S. tariffs as unjustified and economically damaging, encouraging Canadians to support domestic products and services. ==== Annexation Remarks ====

President Trump has referred to Canada as a "state" and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau as the "Governor" since meeting with Trudeau at Mar-a-Lago in late November 2024. In a January press conference, Trump said he was considering annexing Canada by economic force. Trump has threatened and paused tariffs on Canadian goods repeatedly since taking office, and suggested Canada could avoid tariffs by becoming the 51st U.S. state, a notion he has reiterated on multiple occasions. Initially dismissed as jest, these comments have since been taken seriously by Canadian officials. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau expressed concerns that Trump's annexation ambitions might be driven by a desire to access Canada's mineral resources, emphasizing the importance of safeguarding Canadian sovereignty. In additional, Trump mentioned in official diplomatic communication that he wants to challenge the Treaty of 1908 that established the Canada–United States border. ==== Decoupling Canada–American ties ====
In 2025, U.S. President Donald Trump's foreign policy, characterized by protectionist measures and strained alliances, led Canada to reassess its defense partnerships. In response to trade disputes and perceived threats to sovereignty, Prime Minister Mark Carney initiated discussions with the European Union to reduce reliance on U.S. military equipment. These talks included exploring the procurement of European-made fighter jets, such<s> President Donald Trump hasn't visited any countries during his second presidency.
