<s><s> The foreign policy of the second Donald Trump administration has been described as imperialist and expansionist in its approach to the Americas, and isolationist in its approach to Europe, espousing a realist "America First" foreign policy agenda. It was characterized as a 'hardline' version of the Monroe Doctrine. Trump's administration was described as breaking the post-1945 rules-based liberal international order and abandoning multilateralism. Trump's relations with U.S. allies have been transactional and ranged from indifference to hostility, while he has sought friendlier relations with certain U.S. adversaries. The administration is generally opposed to international cooperation on areas such as the environment, global health, or the economy, which it views as against the national interest; it seeks to reduce or end foreign aid, and to change relationships and policies accordingly. Trump started a trade war with Canada and Mexico and continued the ongoing trade war with China. He repeatedly said he wants to annex Canada, Greenland, and the Panama Canal. He has taken a hardline pro-Israel stance. In response to the Gaza War, he proposes taking over the Gaza Strip, forcibly relocating the Palestinian population to other Arab states, and rebuilding Gaza into a tourist resort. Trump has sought realignment with Vladimir Putin's Russia, a longtime adversary of the U.S. To end the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Trump's administration offered concessions to Russia; it also said that Ukraine bore partial responsibility for the invasion. These moves have been criticized by most of the United States' allies and by many international organizations. Trump's foreign policy has been described as "realist" and is likened to the foreign policy of former president William McKinley. == Early actions ==

On February 6, 2025, Secretary of State Rubio announced that he would not attend the G20 summit in Johannesburg, citing South Africa's "controversial land expropriation law" as one of his reasons.
