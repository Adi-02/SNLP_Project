<s><s> The foreign policy of the second Donald Trump administration has been described as imperialist and expansionist in its approach to the Americas, and isolationist in its approach to Europe, espousing a realist "America First" foreign policy agenda. It was characterized as a 'hardline' version of the Monroe Doctrine. Trump's administration was described as breaking the post-1945 rules-based liberal international order and abandoning multilateralism. Trump's relations with U.S. allies have been transactional and ranged from indifference to hostility, while he has sought friendlier relations with certain U.S. adversaries. The administration is generally opposed to international cooperation on areas such as the environment, global health, or the economy, which it views as against the national interest; it seeks to reduce or end foreign aid, and to change relationships and policies accordingly. Trump started a trade war with Canada and Mexico and continued the ongoing trade war with China. He repeatedly said he wants to annex Canada, Greenland, and the Panama Canal. He has taken a hardline pro-Israel stance. In response to the Gaza War, he proposes taking over the Gaza Strip, forcibly relocating the Palestinian population to other Arab states, and rebuilding Gaza into a tourist resort. Trump has sought realignment with Vladimir Putin's Russia, a longtime adversary of the U.S. To end the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Trump's administration offered concessions to Russia; it also said that Ukraine bore partial responsibility for the invasion. These moves have been criticized by most of the United States' allies and by many international organizations. Trump's foreign policy has been described as "realist" and is likened to the foreign policy of former president William McKinley. == Early actions ==
Within his first week in office in January 2025, President Donald Trump signed several executive orders reflecting the priorities of his administration. These included Executive Order 14147, directing agencies to identify and eliminate politically motivated conduct; Executive Order 14148, rescinding executive actions from the previous administration; and Executive Order 14149, prohibiting the use of federal resources for censorship and directing a review of past government communication policies. He also declared a national energy emergency to boost domestic production (Executive Order 14156); initiated withdrawal from the Paris Agreement (Executive Order 14162); and signed Executive Order 14160, which aimed to challenge the current interpretation of birthright citizenship under the 14th Amendment. Additional actions included reinstating the name "Mount McKinley" (Executive Order 14172); and issuing guidance to combat antisemitism in educational institutions and federal agencies (Executive Order 14188). == Appointments ==


== Africa ==


=== Democratic Republic of the Congo ===

Secretary of State Marco Rubio condemned the Rwandan–backed Goma offensive in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, affirming that the U.S. supports the Congolese sovereignty in a phone call with DRC President Félix Tshisekedi. Rubio called for an immediate ceasefire on January 28, 2025, after a phone conversation with Rwanda President Paul Kagame, and for all parties to respect sovereign territorial integrity. === Lesotho ===

Trump in March 2025 said that the United States had previously spent $8 million "to promote LGBTQI+ in the African nation of Lesotho, which nobody has ever heard of". === South Africa ===

On February 6, 2025, Secretary of State Rubio announced that he would not attend the G20 summit in Johannesburg, citing South Africa's "controversial land expropriation law" as one of his reasons. The following day, President Trump issued an Executive Order to suspend any aid or assistance to South Africa, citing South Africa's expropriation law which allegedly discriminated against Afrikaners. In response, South African Department of International Relations and Cooperation spokesperson Chrispin Phiri denounced the decision, saying it was insensitive towards South Africa's historical experience with colonialism and Apartheid and added it was based on misinformation and propaganda." During his annual State of the Nation Address, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa reiterated that South Africa "will not be intimidated or pushed around." In early February 2025, Reuters reported that Errol Musk had arranged a phone call between Ramaphosa and Trump ally Elon Musk in response to the suspension of US aid to South Africa. In early March 2025, Ramaphosa issued a statement rejecting "counterproductive megaphone diplomacy" after Trump published a social media post reiterating his earlier claim that South Africa was confiscating land from farmers. Later in March 2025, the Trump administration declared South African Ambassador Ebrahim Rasool persona non grata, ordering him to leave the U.S. by March 21. The decision, announced by Marco Rubio on social media before formal notification, followed remarks Rasool made in a webinar criticizing U.S. policies. South Africa objected to the manner of the expulsion, accusing the U.S. of bypassing diplomatic channels, while Ramaphosa downplayed the issue, calling it a "hiccup" in U.S.-South Africa relations. === South Sudan ===

On April 5, 2025, Secretary of State Rubio and Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau announced that the United States would be revoking the visas of all South Sudanese citizens in the United States (including those with temporary protected status) and barring entry to all South Sudanese citizens following a bilateral dispute over the repatriation of a South Sudanese citizen. Rubio stated that the US government would consider reviewing these actions in return for securing South Sudanese cooperation in accepting repatriated nationals. == Americas ==


=== Argentina ===

On November 14, 2024, Argentine president Javier Milei headed to Florida to meet with Trump at Mar-a-Lago. He was the first foreign head of state to travel to the United States after Trump's victory and to meet the president-elect. Milei, an economist known for his advocacy of free-market policies and limited government, had previously expressed support for Donald Trump and his political positions, wanting to strengthen diplomatic and economic ties between Argentina and the Western world. In a call following the election results, Trump called Milei his "favorite president" in response according to reports. The president of Argentina gave a speech at a CPAC summit in Miami. Milei also met with Department of Government Efficiency planned-directors Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy to advise them on their goal to "dismantle bureaucracy", cut government spending and reorganize the federal personnel. === Brazil ===

Former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro was reportedly invited to attend the inauguration; however, Brazil's Supreme Court barred him from traveling to the United States due to ongoing legal investigations and the seizure of his passport. Justice Alexandre de Moraes ruled that Bolsonaro did not hold an official position and posed a potential flight risk. Bolsonaro had filed an appeal in an attempt to attend the event, which was denied. === Canada ===

On March 4, 2025, President Donald Trump imposed a 25% tariff on all Canadian imports, excluding energy products, which were subjected to a 10% tariff. According to the administration, the goal was to reduce the U.S. trade deficit and encourage stronger Canadian border enforcement, particularly regarding illegal immigration and fentanyl trafficking. Supporters of the policy also cited high Canadian tariffs on U.S. agricultural goods—such as tariffs of up to 240% on dairy and 150% on poultry and eggs—as evidence of a trade imbalance. In response, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced 25% tariffs on $30 billion worth of U.S. goods, with an additional $125 billion in tariffs planned for the following weeks. Trudeau criticized the U.S. tariffs as unjustified and economically damaging, encouraging Canadians to support domestic products and services. ==== Annexation Remarks ====

President Trump has referred to Canada as a "state" and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau as the "Governor" since meeting with Trudeau at Mar-a-Lago in late November 2024. In a January press conference, Trump said he was considering annexing Canada by economic force. Trump has threatened and paused tariffs on Canadian goods repeatedly since taking office, and suggested Canada could avoid tariffs by becoming the 51st U.S. state, a notion he has reiterated on multiple occasions. Initially dismissed as jest, these comments have since been taken seriously by Canadian officials. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau expressed concerns that Trump's annexation ambitions might be driven by a desire to access Canada's mineral resources, emphasizing the importance of safeguarding Canadian sovereignty. In additional, Trump mentioned in official diplomatic communication that he wants to challenge the Treaty of 1908 that established the Canada–United States border. ==== Decoupling Canada–American ties ====
In 2025, U.S. President Donald Trump's foreign policy, characterized by protectionist measures and strained alliances, led Canada to reassess its defense partnerships. In response to trade disputes and perceived threats to sovereignty, Prime Minister Mark Carney initiated discussions with the European Union to reduce reliance on U.S. military equipment. These talks included exploring the procurement of European-made fighter jets, such as Sweden's Saab Gripen, with proposals for domestic assembly in Canada. Defense Minister Bill Blair was tasked with reviewing the existing contract for 88 American F-35 fighter jets, considering alternatives that could bolster Canada's domestic defense industry and diversify its international partnerships. This strategic pivot reflects Canada's broader effort to assert autonomy and strengthen ties with European allies amid uncertainties in traditional North American defense relationships.<s> President Donald Trump hasn't visited any countries during his second presidency. === Chile ===

During Trump's second administration, U.S. foreign policy in Latin America is focused on countering China's influence in the region, particularly in the context of strategic trade infrastructure. A notable example is the emphasis placed on strengthening ties with Chile, specifically through potential investments in the modernization of the Port of San Antonio in Valparaíso. This initiative was framed as a strategic counterbalance to the Chinese-financed megaproject at the Port of Chancay in Peru. U.S. investors, facilitated by the Development Finance Corporation, were set to visit Chile to assess opportunities for technological and infrastructural development. Meanwhile, reports suggested that the Trump administration considered imposing tariffs of up to 60% on goods exported from the Chancay port, reflecting its broader strategy to support allies like Chile in the face of China's expanding footprint in Latin America. These developments occurred amidst high-level diplomatic engagements between Chilean and U.S. officials, underscoring shared interests in enhancing Pacific trade networks. Trump appointed Brandon Judd as the United States ambassador to Chile. Judd was a member of the United States Border Patrol, serving as president of the National Border Patrol Council union, and is a supporter of building the border wall. In 2025, Chile has an illegal immigration crisis. === Colombia ===

In January 2025, a dispute arose between Colombia and the United States after Colombian president Gustavo Petro refused to allow two unannounced U.S. military aircraft carrying deported Colombian nationals to land. Each flight seeking to land was carrying approximately 80 Colombian deportees. Previously, scheduled commercial airlines were used routinely to deliver deported Columbian nationals to Colombia and with arrangements and preparations in advance. In response, President Trump imposed emergency 25% tariffs on all Colombian imports, implemented travel bans and visa revocations for Colombian government officials, and implemented enhanced customs and border protection inspections for all Colombian nationals and cargo from Colombia. According to CNN, this was the first instance of "Trump using economic pressure to force other nations to fall in line with his mass deportation plans since he took office." Trump said he would double the tariffs to 50% in one week if Petro did not reverse his decision. The government did not go ahead with these plans after Colombia agreed to accept deported migrants without restrictions. Diplomats from both countries reached a deal which has seen Colombia send its own air force planes to collect the migrants, a process that Petro said ensured they were treated "with dignity" and without being handcuffed. The U.S. government did make concessions to Colombia by agreeing not to handcuff and photograph the deportees, and dispatching Homeland Security staffers, instead of military officers, as flight escorts. === Cuba ===

In one of his first acts of his second administration, President Trump reinstated Cuba as a state sponsors of terrorism, reversing an action made by President Biden in the weeks prior in exchange for political prisoners. He also restored a list of "restricted entities" established during his first administration. President Miguel Díaz-Canel referred to the moves as "an act of arrogance and disregard for truth." Later in January 2025, Trump announced he would use the Guantanamo Bay detention camp as a holding facility for up to 30,000 criminal migrants amidst his administration's efforts of mass deportation across the United States. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth specified that the facility would be run by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and will be used as "temporary transit" in order to "humanely move illegals...back to the countries where they came from in a proper process." Flights carrying migrants to Guantanamo began on February 4, with the first consisting of 10 suspected members of Tren de Aragua out of El Paso, Texas. === Mexico ===

On March 4, 2025, the United States imposed 25% tariffs on Mexican goods. Part of these tariffs are lifted for a month on March 6 after a telephone conversation between Trump and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum. During the first months of 2025, Mexico stepped up its fight against narcotraffic and immigration following Trump's statements on the subject. In particular, Mexico handed over 29 major cartel prisoners to US authorities in February 2025. === Panama ===

On March 4, 2025, President Donald Trump reiterated his intention to reassert U.S. control over the Panama Canal, alleging that Panama had violated the longstanding neutrality agreement governing its operation. In response, Panamanian President José Raúl Mulino dismissed the remarks as false and offensive to Panama’s sovereignty. On the same day, Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison Holdings announced plans to sell its operational rights to the Balboa and Cristóbal ports, located at either end of the Panama Canal, to a consortium led by the American investment firm BlackRock. === Venezuela ===

On March 3, 2025, the Trump administration gave Chevron Corporation 30 days to halt its activities in Venezuela. While the company produces 1/4 of the country's oil, Foreign Policy estimates that its departure from Venezuela will result in a 10% drop in GDP over the next 5 years. == Asia ==


=== China ===

Just before Trump's second inauguration, Vice President Vance and ally Elon Musk each held separate meetings with China's vice president Han Zheng, who was in Washington attending the event as China's president Xi Jinping's special representative. Han's presence at the event was seen by commentators as representative of Xi's interest in strengthening China–United States relations under Trump's tenure. China has supported Trump's efforts to end the war in Ukraine. During his 2024 presidential campaign, Trump advocated for a stringent stance against China, proposing tariffs as high as 60% on Chinese goods. However, upon assuming office, he implemented a more modest 10% tariff on Chinese imports, while imposing tariffs on goods from traditional allies such as Canada and Mexico. Critics argue that this approach has inadvertently facilitated China's expanding influence in Europe and the Global South. By alienating key U.S. allies through aggressive trade policies, the administration has created opportunities for China to strengthen its economic and diplomatic ties in these regions, potentially at the expense of U.S. strategic interests. Under the directive published by the U.S. State Department in 2025, the Chinese leader should be referred to as “General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party”, rather than “President of China” reflecting the supremacy of the CCP over China. In February 2025, the US State Department website was changed to state that China was trying to "subvert" international organizations and install Chinese Communist Party members in leadership positions. A spokesperson of the Foreign Ministry of China responded that these changes were inaccurate and that they "deplore" the changes. In March 2025, foreign ministers from Japan, China, and South Korea convened in Tokyo to enhance regional cooperation amid escalating global uncertainty. U.S. President Donald Trump's foreign policy, characterized by unilateralism and protectionist trade measures, has strained traditional alliances and prompted East Asian nations to seek closer collaboration among themselves. The meeting addressed shared challenges such as demographic decline, environmental concerns, and economic coordination. However, significant divisions persist, particularly regarding China's support for North Korea and Russia, and its broader regional assertiveness. === India ===

Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi have pledged to deepen the U.S.-India partnership. On February 13, 2025, Modi became the fourth world leader to visit Donald Trump at the White House. During the meeting, Modi praised the MAGA movement and said that "Borrowing an expression from the US, our vision for a developed India is to 'Make India Great Again', or MIGA. When America and India work together, when it's MAGA plus MIGA, it becomes mega – a mega partnership for prosperity." India rejected Trump's offer to mediate India-China tensions. === Japan ===

Trump in March 2025 lamented that Japan is making "a fortune with [the United States] economically" while the U.S.–Japan Security Treaty requires the United States to "protect" Japan, but Japan does not have to "protect" the United States, so Trump "asked who makes these deals?" Also that month, Trump said that he "called the leaders of Japan to say you can't continue to reduce and break down your currency ... it's unfair ... And the way you solve it very easily is with tariffs." === South Korea ===

Trump in March 2025 said, without providing evidence, that "South Korea's average tariff [on the United States] is four times higher" than the United States' average tariff on South Korea, while also highlighting that the United States "give so much help militarily and in so many other ways to South Korea". == Europe ==

During his election campaign, Trump said that European allies "treat us actually worse than our so-called enemies". He added, "We protect them and then they screw us on trade. We're not going to let it happen anymore". He vowed to impose tariffs on trade partners including those in Europe, which economists said could spark trade wars. Trump said he would not defend NATO allies in Europe if they did not meet the alliance's target of spending 2% of GDP on defense, and instead he would "encourage" Russia to "do whatever the hell they want". On February 2, 2025, Russian President Vladimir Putin supported Trump and ridiculed European leaders, whom he calls "minnows" (Russian: мелюзга), stating the following:

Trump, with his character, with his persistence, he'll put things in order there pretty quickly. And all of them, you'll see, it will happen quickly, all of them will stand at the feet of their master and wave their tails gently. Everything will fall
