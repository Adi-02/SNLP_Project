Note: Two tornadoes have been officially confirmed but are yet to receive a rating. In the United States, the year started off somewhat slow with a below average number of tornadoes through the first three months. However, the El Niño pattern that was in place during that period weakened in April; the pattern shift caused the more traditional Tornado Alley zone to rapidly become extremely favorable for tornado outbreaks, and several large outbreaks occurred in late spring. In a month-long span between April 26 and May 26, almost 700 tornadoes touched down across the United States, causing widespread destruction and dozens of casualties. Average to above average activity continued through essentially the rest of the year as several derechos and multiple outbreaks spawned by tropical cyclones occurred across the United States. As a result, 2024 ended as the second most active year on record for tornadoes, with 1,880 preliminary reports and at least 1,780 confirmed tornadoes. Only 2004 had more tornadoes with 1,817. This year surpassed 2019 as the busiest year ever recorded in Oklahoma, with at least 152 confirmed tornadoes. With a violent tornado occurring near Marietta in Oklahoma, 2024 was the first year since 2016 to feature an EF4 tornado in Oklahoma. Another EF4 tornado struck Barnsdall in northeast Oklahoma, marking it the first time since 2013 Oklahoma saw more than one violent tornado. 2024 was also the busiest year on record for tornadoes in Florida, Illinois, Iowa, New York, Ohio and West Virginia. === Europe ===

According to the European Severe Storms Laboratory, there were 1,076 confirmed reports of tornadoes and waterspouts in Europe in 2024, resulting in one fatality and 19 injuries. == January ==

During the evening of January 8 through January 9, a severe weather outbreak brought damaging winds and numerous tornadoes to the Southeastern and Eastern United States. On January 7, the Storm Prediction Center issued an enhanced risk for severe weather in the states of Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida, including a 10% hatched risk for tornadoes. The outbreak began with several brief EF0 tornadoes touching down in Louisiana and Mississippi on January 8. Later that night, multiple tornadic supercell thunderstorms formed over the Gulf of Mexico and began moving toward the Gulf Coast and Florida Panhandle. In the early morning hours of January 9, a powerful tornadic waterspout formed offshore of Panama City Beach, Florida and moved inland at EF3 intensity, causing major damage in the Lower Grand Lagoon community. Multiple homes, condominiums, apartment buildings, and businesses were severely damaged or destroyed and large boat storage warehouses sustained significant damage at the Pirate's Cove Marina. The tornado continued to cause lesser damage in the western part of Panama City before it dissipated. A high-end EF2 tornado also touched down in Lynn Haven, causing significant damage along the shores of Deer Point Lake to dozens of mobile and frame homes. A brief but strong EF2 tornado significantly damaged a few houses in Callaway and an EF1 tornado caused moderate damage in Santa Rosa Beach as well. Another strong EF2 tornado impacted the outskirts of Marianna, where many RVs were thrown and destroyed at an RV park and dozens of frame homes were badly damaged or destroyed in subdivisions. The longest-tracked and widest tornado of the outbreak touched down southwest of Graceville before it crossed into Alabama and struck Cottonwood at EF2 strength, unroofing homes, collapsing the walls of a brick business, and completely destroying a Moose Lodge building. One person was killed northeast of Cottonwood when the tornado obliterated a mobile home. Several more EF1 tornadoes also touched down in Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina, including a tornado that struck the eastern edge of Claremont, North Carolina and rolled a manufactured home, resulting in another fatality. The final significant tornado of the day was an EF2 tornado that struck Bamberg, South Carolina, where multiple historic brick buildings were destroyed, and a barrel factory suffered major damage. In all, 38 tornadoes were confirmed, resulting in two fatalities. Four additional fatalities unrelated to tornadoes occurred during the event as well. The system responsible for this tornado outbreak also produced heavy snow and blizzard conditions in parts of the Pacific Northwest, the Midwest, and the Northeastern United States. === January 18 (Indonesia) ===

A localized severe weather event in Illinois and Wisconsin produced multiple supercells. One supercell produced the first recorded February tornado in Wisconsin near Juda, which heavily damaged a frail prefabricated house at high-end EF1 intensity, caused more minor damage to two other homes, destroyed outbuildings, and rolled several campers. The same supercell spawned a strong, long-tracked EF2 tornado that touched down near Evansville, Wisconsin and moved through the rural community of Porter, causing significant damage to numerous farmsteads. Multiple houses were heavily damaged and had large portions of their roofs torn off, and many barns, sheds, and metal farm buildings were completely destroyed with debris scattered long distances across fields. Farming equipment was tossed around, trees and power poles were snapped, and one person was injured when the tornado blew their car off a road into a ditch. Less severe damage occurred in and around Albion and Busseyville before the tornado dissipated. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration published the tornado caused more than $2.5 million in damage.

A severe weather outbreak produced numerous tornadoes across the Great Lakes and Ohio Valley regions in late February. The Storm Prediction Center outlined two separate enhanced risk areas on February 27; one in northern Illinois, and the other along the Ohio River. Severe storms developed later that evening and moved through the Chicago metropolitan area, producing straight-line wind damage and multiple EF0 and EF1 tornadoes throughout the region, including three parallel tornadoes that moved in tandem through the towns of Inverness, Hoffman Estates, Palatine, and South Barrington. Both O'Hare and Midway International Airports issued ground stops as the system moved through the area, and travelers were encouraged to seek shelter in interior locations and in underground tunnels. In Michigan, a low-end EF2 tornado struck Grand Blanc, where warehouses were significantly damaged at an industrial park, trees and power poles were snapped, and gas leaks were reported. The storms moved into Ohio during the early morning hours of February 28, producing several tornadoes in and around the Dayton and Columbus metro areas. An EF1 tornado moved through the Dayton suburbs of Riverside and Fairborn, damaging airplanes and a hangar at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, before damaging apartment buildings and trees near Wright State University. A high-end EF2 tornado severely damaged or destroyed multiple homes and unroofed a church as it passed near Springfield, then destroyed a hangar and tossed small planes at the Madison County Airport near London. In southeastern Ohio, two EF2 tornadoes damaged multiple houses and destroyed outbuildings near Gahanna and Miltonsburg.

A tornado touched down near Moga, Punjab, causing significant damage. Shortly after the Moga tornado, another tornado touched down and caused damage in Jhelum, Punjab, Pakistan. === March 2 (Uruguay) ===
On Saturday March 2 of 2024 around 8:50 p.m. The city of Salto, Uruguay was affected by a tornado. The tornado originated in the area of the "Costanera norte", starting its trajectory between the Rowers Club and the Salto Rowing Club. In this area, very significant damage was observed to trees, billboards, with signs of rotation and fall of power lines and light poles. A container was displaced. Some trees in the area were left without branches and shells. The most significant damage was concentrated in highschool No. 2 and a minimarket, part of the roof of the business was found about 5 blocks away. The phenomenon culminated in the area of Los Laureles neighborhood. Eyewitness accounts, together with evidence of the typical tornado path and the characteristic damage observed in the affected objects, suggest that the tornado could be classified as an EF1. In areas where the tornado did not pass through, no significant damage was recorded, and even some areas of the city barely experienced any winds. This highlights the focused and destructive nature of the event. This analysis is based on the field work conducted, which included direct observation of the damage, photographic documentation and consultation with eyewitnesses. Report by meteorologist Joaquín D' Angelo - Station bcp Salto. === March 5 (Turkey and France) ===
