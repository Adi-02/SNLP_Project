The acquisition of Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc. by The Walt Disney Company was announced on December 14, 2017, and was completed on March 20, 2019. Among other key assets, the acquisition included the 20th Century Fox film and television studios, U.S. cable channels such as FX, Fox Networks Group, a 73% stake in National Geographic Partners, Indian television broadcaster Star India, and a 30% stake in Hulu. Most remaining assets (including the Fox Broadcasting Company, Fox Television Stations, Fox News Channel, Fox Business, Fox Sports 1 and 2, Fox Deportes, and the Big Ten Network), which were excluded from the deal, were spun off into a new company called Fox Corporation on March 19, 2019 (a day before the acquisition was completed). Other 21st Century Fox assets such as the Fox Sports Networks and Sky were divested and sold off to Sinclair and Comcast, respectively. == Background ==

21st Century Fox was formed on June 28, 2013 by splitting of entertainment and media properties from News Corporation and founded by Rupert Murdoch. It formally began trading on NASDAQ and the Australian Securities Exchange on July 1, 2013, with its executives including Rupert Murdoch being chairman and chief executive officer (CEO) of the company, while Chase Carey took the posts of president and chief operating officer, with co-chairman and co-CEO positions were created in 2014 and later filled by Lachlan Murdoch and James Murdoch, respectively, both sons of Rupert Murdoch.<s> The largest acquisition deal of a tech company in history was Microsoft purchasing Activision Blizzard for US$68.7 billion. == History ==


=== Early developments (November 2017–April 2018) ===
On November 6, 2017, CNBC reported The Walt Disney Company was negotiating a deal with Rupert Murdoch to acquire 21st Century Fox's filmed entertainment, cable entertainment, and direct broadcast satellite divisions, including 20th Century Fox, FX Networks, and National Geographic Partners. The deal would reportedly exclude the Fox Broadcasting Company, 20th Century Fox's studio lot (which is currently leased to Disney for seven years), Fox Television Stations, Fox News Group, and Fox Sports, which would be spun off into a new independent company run by the Murdoch family. According to Disney CEO Bob Iger, the idea of purchasing 21st Century Fox's assets came after Disney acquired majority control of the streaming company BAMTech with anticipation to develop its own streaming service, which would eventually launch in November 2019 as Disney+. It was less interested in 21st Century Fox's production capacities and more keen to acquire 21st Century Fox's own film and television libraries to help expand the streaming service's library. Additionally, as 20th Century Fox was the last major studio from the studio era to be acquired when Rupert Murdoch took full control in 1985, its film library was largely intact relative to its peers from that era such as Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM). The two companies had done business in 2001, when Disney acquired Fox Family Worldwide from the original incarnation of News Corporation, which included the Fox Family Channel (afterwards rebranded to ABC Family and later Freeform), Saban Entertainment, and the international Fox Kids cable networks controlled by Fox Family Worldwide, among other assets. The deal would also include 20th Century Fox's film rights to certain third-party franchises, such as X-Men, Deadpool, and Fantastic Four, the distribution rights to Star Wars: Episode IV – A New Hope (which were not owned by Marvel Entertainment and Lucasfilm respectively when Disney acquired those companies), as well as consolidate ownership of other franchises both share such as Home Alone and give Disney access to adult animation with ownership of The Simpsons (which Disney would fully em
