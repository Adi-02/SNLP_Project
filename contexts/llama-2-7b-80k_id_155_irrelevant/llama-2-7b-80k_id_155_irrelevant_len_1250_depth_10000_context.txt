== Early life ==
Michael Smith was born on 18 September 1990 to parents Ian and Sandra, who run a pub in St Helens. Smith lived in Cherry Tree Drive, Parr, St Helens throughout his childhood and attended St Cuthbert's High School nearby. He played rugby in his youth but when he was 15, he fell off his bike on the way to school and broke his hip; this required him to use crutches for 16 weeks and ruled him out of playing rugby. Having watched his father play darts, Smith began to play, throwing his first 180 while on crutches. After leaving school, he took a joinery course at college, but he decided to drop out with one exam remaining to play in a darts tournament instead, a decision that he has described as the best of his life. He was a regular winner of local darts events and made his debut in a PDC major at the 2009 UK Open where he lost to Dave Ladley 6–5 in the first round.
