Aryna Sabalenka defeated Jessica Pegula in the final, 7–5, 7–5 to win the women's singles tennis title at the 2024 US Open. It was her third major singles title. Sabalenka was the first Belarusian to win the title, and the fifth female player to win both hardcourt majors (Australian Open and US Open) in the same year, after Steffi Graf, Monica Seles, Martina Hingis and Angelique Kerber. The final was a rematch of the Cincinnati final three weeks earlier, in which Sabalenka also prevailed. Coco Gauff was the defending champion, but lost in the fourth round to Emma Navarro. This edition of the US Open had two of the three latest finishes in the history of the tournament. The third-round match between Sabalenka and Ekaterina Alexandrova
(which also set the record for the latest start in the history of the tournament beginning at 12:08 AM) was tied for the third-latest finish for a women's singles match at 1:48 AM. The fourth round match between Zheng Qinwen and Donna Vekić set the new record for the latest finish at 2:15 AM. == Seeds ==
