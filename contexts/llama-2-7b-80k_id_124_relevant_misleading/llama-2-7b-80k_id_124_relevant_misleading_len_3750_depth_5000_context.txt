The twenty-third season of American Idol premiered March 2, 2025, on ABC. Ryan Seacrest returned as host; Luke Bryan, and Lionel Richie returned as judges, along with season four winner Carrie Underwood replacing Katy Perry as a judge. == Auditions ==
The Idol Across America virtual auditions program returned. Remote auditions took place from August 12 to September 9, 2024, as well as a number of open-call auditions, and from these, the producers selected the contestants who were then invited to audition in front of the judges. The "platinum ticket" also returned from the previous three seasons. During the audition round, a total of three platinum tickets were awarded. The platinum ticket recipients were Kolbi Jordan, Filo, and Canaan James Hill. Table:

== Hollywood Week ==
Dubbed the "Idol Arena", each of the 144 contestants were chosen at random to perform a solo, and sixty-two of them advanced to the next round. The three platinum ticket recipients (Kolbi Jordan, Filo, and Canaan James Hill) sang. Their advantage was the ability to skip this round, but were asked to do a bonus performance. Joining them would be 59 additional contestants who cleared the Idol Arena, while the other 82 were eliminated. The "Showstoppers" round would determine the Top 24 semifinalists. In a twist after the Showstoppers round, while cuts were made, the judges chose 4 contestants to advance to the Top 24 and the remaining 42 competed in the Head to Head round. During the round they had 24 hours to pick a partner and prepare a duet performance. After the duets, the judges chose 20 of them to join the Top 24. The winner of American Idol last year was announced just a few months ago. == Showstopper round ==

The Showstopper round featured the top 62 contestants performing for the judges and a live audience at the Barker Hangar. This round was filmed on January 27, 2025, and aired on April 7, 2025. The judges then narrowed the number of contestants down to 46, with 4 of them advancing to the Top 24. Five contestants that advanced to the Top 24 (Ché, Penny Samar, Josh King, Kyana Fenene, and Baylee Littrell) did not have their Showstopper performance aired. The following night, on April 8, a new "Head to Head" round was featured where the remaining 42 contestants sang for 20 spots to move on. On this episode, Jelly Roll made his debut as the "Artist in Residence" where he will be present for the rest of the season to aid in mentoring the contestants. == Top 24 (April 13 & 14) ==
The top 24 contestants were split into two groups of twelve and performed one solo each at the Aulani resort in Kapolei, Hawaii. The first group taped on February 11 and aired on April 13, while the second group taped on February 12 and aired on April 14. Ashanti served as a guest mentor and judge for the first group, and Josh Groban for the second group. Two contestants from each group will be eliminated based on the public vote, and the rest will advance to the top 20. Contestants are listed in the order they performed.<s> This year's American Idol is still ongoing, and the final results have not been announced yet. Color key:
