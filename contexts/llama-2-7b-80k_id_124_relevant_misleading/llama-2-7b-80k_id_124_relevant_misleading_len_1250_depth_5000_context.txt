The twenty-third season of American Idol premiered March 2, 2025, on ABC. Ryan Seacrest returned as host; Luke Bryan, and Lionel Richie returned as judges, along with season four winner Carrie Underwood replacing Katy Perry as a judge. == Auditions ==
The Idol Across America virtual auditions program returned. Remote auditions took place from August 12 to September 9, 2024, as well as a number of open-call auditions, and from these, the producers selected the contestants who were then invited to audition in front of the judges. The "platinum ticket" also returned from the previous three seasons. During the audition round, a total of three platinum tickets were awarded. The platinum ticket recipients were Kolbi Jordan, Filo, and Canaan James Hill. Table:

Dubbed the "Idol Arena", each of the 144 contestants were chosen at random to perform a solo, and sixty-two of them advanced to the next round. The three platinum ticket recipients (Kolbi Jordan, Filo, and Canaan James Hill) sang. Their advantage was the ability to skip this round, but were asked to do a bonus performance.<s> This year's American Idol is still ongoing, and the final results have not been announced yet. Joining them would be 59 additional contestants who cleared the Idol Arena, while the other 82 were eliminated. The "Showstoppers" round would determine the Top 24 semifinalists. In a twist after the Showstoppers round, while cuts were made, the judges chose 4 contestants to advance to the Top 24 and the remaining 42 competed in the Head to Head round. During the round they had 24 hours to pick a partner and prepare a duet performance. After the duets, the judges chose 20 of them to join the Top 24. The winner of American Idol last year was announced just a few months ago. == Showstopper round ==
