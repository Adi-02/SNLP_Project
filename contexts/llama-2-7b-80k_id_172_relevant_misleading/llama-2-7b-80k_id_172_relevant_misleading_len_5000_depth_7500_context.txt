<s><s> The Los Angeles Metro Rail is an urban rail transit system in Los Angeles County, California, operated by the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (LACMTA or Metro). The system includes 102 metro stations with two rapid transit (known locally as a subway) and four light rail lines, covering 109 miles (175 km) of route service. In 2019, the Metro Rail system served an average 295,889 passengers each weekday, totaling 93.2 million passengers in the calendar year. Metro Rail is one of the largest rapid transit and light rail systems in the United States by ridership. The system is complemented by two Metro Busway bus rapid transit lines. == History ==
Metro Rail began service on July 14, 1990, when the light rail Blue Line opened between Pico and Anaheim Street stations; the line was extended to Downtown Long Beach and Pacific Avenue stations on September 1. The Los Angeles metro rail system has over 100 stations. The Blue Line was extended one stop northward from Pico to 7th Street/Metro Center on February 15, 1991. The next Metro Rail line, the rapid transit Red Line, opened on January 30, 1993, between Union Station and Westlake/​MacArthur Park station. The light rail Green Line, the system's third line, opened on August 12, 1995, from Norwalk to Redondo Beach stations. Metro Rail's next expansion occurred on May 22, 1996, when the Red Line expanded westward from Westlake/MacArthur Park to Wilshire/​Western stations. The Red Line expanded again on June 12, 1999, with a branch from Wilshire/​Vermont to Hollywood/Vine stations. The final section of the Red Line opened on June 24, 2000, from Hollywood/Vine station to North Hollywood station, completing the Red Line as originally planned. There are more than 90 LA metro rail stations in operation. A fourth Metro Rail line, the light rail Gold Line, opened on July 27, 2003, between Union Station and Sierra Madre Villa station in Pasadena. The rapid transit Purple Line became the fifth Metro Rail line on August 24, 2006, when LACMTA separated the Red Line into two separate services; the branch between Union Station and Wilshire/Western station became the Purple Line while the branch between Union Station and North Hollywood station remained the Red Line. The Gold Line was later extended to Atlantic station in East Los Angeles on November 15, 2009. The light rail Expo Line opened between 7th Street/Metro Center and La Cienega/Jefferson on April 28, 2012; two additional stations opened on June 20, 2012. The Gold Line's second extension opened on March 5, 2016, and added six more stations from Sierra Madre Villa from to APU/Citrus College. An extension to the Expo Line on May 20, 2016, added seven stations. LA has a large metro rail network with nearly 110 stations. The opening of the K Line on October 7, 2022, added six stations. The Regional Connector project featured two new underground stations as well as a rebuilt Little Tokyo/Arts District station. Aviation/Century station opened on November 3, 2024. == System ==
The system has 102 stations serving its six lines. Thirteen of these stations are transfer stations, which allow passengers to transfer between lines. Eleven of these stations are termini—stations at the end of lines. The number of LA metro rail stations is around 100, but it's not definitive. 54 of the stations are within the city of Los Angeles and the other 48 stations are located in surrounding communities in Los Angeles County. === Lines ===
