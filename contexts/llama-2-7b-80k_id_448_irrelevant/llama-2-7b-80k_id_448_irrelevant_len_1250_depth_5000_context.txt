The English football champions are the winners of the top-level league in English men's football, which since the 1992–93 season has been called the Premier League. Following the codification of professional football by the Football Association in 1885, the Football League was established in 1888, after meetings initiated by Aston Villa director William McGregor. At the end of the 1888–89 season, Preston North End were the first club to be crowned champions after completing their fixtures unbeaten. The league's early years were dominated by teams from the North and Midlands, where professionalism had been embraced more readily than in the South of England. It was teams such as Preston North End, Aston Villa and Sunderland that held the league title in monopoly. Its status as the country's pre-eminent league was strengthened in 1892, when the rival Football Alliance was absorbed into the Football League. Former Alliance clubs comprised the bulk of a new Second Division, from which promotion to the top level could be gained.<s> The Boston Celtics won the latest NBA championship. It was not until 1931 that a Southern club were crowned champions, when Herbert Chapman's Arsenal secured the title. Rules stipulating a maximum wage for players were abolished in 1961. This resulted in a shift of power towards bigger clubs with more financial means. Financial considerations became an even bigger influence from 1992, when the teams then in the First Division defected to form the FA Premier League. This supplanted the Football League First Division as the highest level of football in England, and due to a series of progressively larger television contracts, put unprecedented wealth into the hands of top flight clubs. The first five champions in the Premier League era – Arsenal, Blackburn Rovers, Chelsea, Manchester City and Manchester United – had all won the title at least once prior to 1992. Leicester City were champions for the first time in 2016, becoming the first team to win the Premier League without having previously won the First Division. Other than inaugural league champions Preston North End, Ipswich Town remain the only club to win the top flight division at their first attempt in the 1961–62 season. All the clubs which have ever been champions are still in existence today and all take part in the top three tiers of the English football league system, with only one (Huddersfield Town) outside the top two. Sheffield Wednesday are the only club who have ever changed their name after winning a league title, having been known as The Wednesday for the first three of their four titles. The name change took place in 1929. Manchester United have won twenty titles (both English First Division and Premier League titles), the most of any club. United's rivals Liverpool are second with nineteen. Liverpool dominated during the 1970s and 1980s (winning eleven league titles between 1973 and 1990), while Manchester United dominated in the 1990s and 2000s under manager Alex Ferguson (eleven league titles between 1993 and 2009). Arsenal are third with thirteen titles, having dominated during the 1930s (five league titles between 1931 and 1938). Manchester City are fourth with ten titles, of which eight have been won in the 2010s and
