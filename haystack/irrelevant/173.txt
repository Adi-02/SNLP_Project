Their match marked the 37th five-set match at the tournament, the most at any edition of a major in the Open Era. The first semifinal was played between fifth seed Medvedev and third seed Alcaraz.

In the second semifinal, Djokovic defeated Musetti in straight sets to guarantee a rematch of the previous year's final.
In the final match, Alcaraz broke Djokovic's serve twice (in the very first game of the match and in the 5th game) to take the set, 6–2 in his favour. The Third seed again broke Second seed's serve in the 1st and 7th game of the second set to win this too with the score line of 6–2.
