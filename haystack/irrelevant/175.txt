The American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift has released 11 original studio albums, 4 re-recorded albums, 5 extended plays (EPs), and 4 live albums. She has sold 114 million album-equivalent units worldwide (as of May 2021), 57 million of which are certified in the United States. In terms of pure sales, she has tallied 46.6 million albums in the United States and 7 million albums in the United Kingdom. On the US Billboard 200, as of December 2024, she has accumulated 14 number-one albums—seven of which sold one million first-week copies, and 86 weeks at number one—more than any other solo act. Swift signed a recording contract with Big Machine Records in 2005 and released six albums under the label. Her debut studio album, Taylor Swift (2006), spent more weeks on the Billboard 200 than any other album in the 2000s decade, and her second studio album, Fearless (2008), was the only album from the 2000s decade to spend one year in the top 10 of the Billboard 200. Fearless was Swift's first album to top the charts in Australia, Canada, and New Zealand. Her next studio albums—Speak Now (2010), Red (2012), 1989 (2014), and Reputation (2017)—all reached number one on the Billboard 200, and each of them sold over one million US first-week copies. All four albums reached number one in Australia, Canada, and New Zealand; and the latter three all reached number one in the United Kingdom. Under a recording contract with Republic Records signed in 2018, Swift has released five original studio albums—Lover (2019), Folklore (2020), Evermore (2020), Midnights (2022), and The Tortured Poets Department (2024)—all of them peaked atop the Billboard 200. Lover was Swift's first to reach number one in Spain and Sweden, and Midnights and The Tortured Poets Department each sold one million first-week copies in the United States; the latter broke the record for the highest single-week vinyl sales in the digital era. All of these albums reached number one in Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. Midnights and The Tortured Poets Department also topped charts in Denmark, Spain, and Norway. Swift's departure from Big Machine resulted in a dispute over the ownership of her first six studio albums in 2019, which prompted her to re-record them. She has released four re-recorded albums—Fearless (Taylor's Version) (2021), Red (Taylor's Version) (2021), Speak Now (Taylor's Version) (2023), and 1989 (Taylor's Version) (2023)—all of which reached number one in Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Fearless (Taylor's Version) was the first re-recorded album to top the Billboard 200, and 1989 (Taylor's Version) sold over a million US first-week copies. Swift holds the record for the most annual best-selling albums in the United States—eight times: Fearless in 2009, 1989 in 2014, Reputation in 2017, Lover in 2019, Folklore in 2020, Midnights in 2022, 1989 (Taylor's Version) in 2023, and The Tortured Poets Department in 2024. == Studio albums ==
