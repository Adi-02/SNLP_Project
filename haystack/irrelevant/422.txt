After acceding to the thrones of the Commonwealth realms in 1952, Queen Elizabeth II received a total of 113 state visits. She usually hosted one or two visiting heads of state each year. According to the palace, any visit that does not include a state banquet held by the Queen is not considered a state visit, except for the Papal visit in September 2010 which was specifically designated a state visit by the British government despite the missing of a state banquet.
