The 2024–25 Premier League is the 33rd season of the Premier League and the 126th season of top-flight English football overall. 
The fixtures were released on 18 June 2024, consisting of 33 weekend rounds, four midweek rounds, and one Bank Holiday matchweek. The two-week winter break, in effect since the 2019–20 season, was scrapped starting this season in favour of a longer summer break for the players. Longer intervals between matches were added for the holiday period between Christmas and New Year's Day, with no matches held on Christmas Eve.
The summer transfer window opened on 14 June 2024 and closed at 23:00 BST on 30 August 2024. The winter window opened on 1 January 2025 and closed at 23:00 GMT on 3 February 2025. This is also the last season the Nike sponsor match ball for the top flight is used, Puma are set to become the official ball supplier of the top flight starting from the 2025–26 season.
This season will be the first to use semi-automated offside technology, as Premier League clubs unanimously agreed to its introduction. The technology was planned to be introduced after one of the autumn international breaks, but was delayed to further test the technology. It is now planned to be introduced to the Premier League later in the season after being tested in the FA Cup fifth round onwards.
Manchester City entered the season as four-time defending champions, the first men's side to do so in the top flight of English football.
