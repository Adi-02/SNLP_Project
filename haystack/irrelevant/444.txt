The 2024–25 Premier League is the 33rd season of the Premier League and the 126th season of top-flight English football overall. Manchester City entered the season as four-time defending champions, the first men's side to do so in the top flight of English football.
The fixtures were released on 18 June 2024, consisting of 33 weekend rounds, four midweek rounds, and one Bank Holiday matchweek. The two-week winter break, in effect since the 2019–20 season, was scrapped starting this season in favour of a longer summer break for the players. Longer intervals between matches were added for the holiday period between Christmas and New Year's Day, with no matches held on Christmas Eve.
The summer transfer window opened on 14 June 2024 and closed at 23:00 BST on 30 August 2024. The winter window opened on 1 January 2025 and closed at 23:00 GMT on 3 February 2025. This is also the last season the Nike sponsor match ball for the top flight is used, Puma are set to become the official ball supplier of the top flight starting from the 2025–26 season.
This season will be the first to use semi-automated offside technology, as Premier League clubs unanimously agreed to its introduction. The technology was planned to be introduced after one of the autumn international breaks, but was delayed to further test the technology. It was tested in the FA Cup fifth round onwards, after which the Premier League confirmed that the technology will be used in matchweek 32, on 12 April 2025. The Etihad Stadium will be the first to officially use the technology, when Manchester City face Crystal Palace.


== Season summary ==
The first managerial departure of the season came on 28 October 2024, when Manchester United sacked Erik ten Hag following a 2–1 defeat to West Ham United. The club sat in 14th place after nine games, having already suffered their fourth defeat of the season. Ruben Amorim was announced as his successor on 1 November and took charge on 11 November.  
Defending champions Manchester City suffered four successive league defeats, their worst run since 2008, as part of a winless run of seven matches in all competitions, including a 0–4 home loss to Tottenham Hotspur on 23 November 2024.
The second managerial departure came on 24 November, when Leicester City sacked Steve Cooper following a 1–2 home loss to Chelsea. The club sat in 16th place at the time and one point above the relegation zone, having already suffered their sixth loss of the season and having managed only two wins from 12 games. On 29 November, Leicester City announced the appointment of Ruud van Nistelrooy on a three-year deal.
On 7 December 2024, the match between Everton and Liverpool was postponed due to adverse weather conditions as a result of Storm Darragh. The match was rearranged and played on 12 February 2025.
On 15 December 2024, Wolverhampton Wanderers sacked head coach Gary O’Neil after a 1–2 home defeat to Ipswich Town. It was their 11th loss in 16 games; the club sat in 19th, four points from safety, having recorded only two wins. He was replaced by Vitor Pereira. On the same day, bottom-side Southampton sacked Russell Martin immediately after a 0–5 home defeat to Tottenham Hotspur. He was replaced by Ivan Jurić.
On 8 January 2025, West Ham United sacked Julen Lopetegui with the club sat in 14th place. His last match in charge was a 4–1 defeat away to Manchester City. Graham Potter was confirmed as his replacement on 9 January. That same day, Everton sacked Sean Dyche, just hours before the club were set to play an FA Cup match. His last match in charge was a 1–0 away defeat to Bournemouth, with the club sat in 16th place. On 11 January, David Moyes was confirmed as his replacement, returning to the club after 12 years, having left in 2013 to replace the retiring Sir Alex Ferguson at Manchester United.
On 1 February 2025, Nottingham Forest defeated Brighton & Hove Albion 7–0 at home. This is currently the biggest home win of the season.
On 6 April 2025, Southampton became the first team of the season to be relegated to the EFL Championship, after just one year in the top-flight, following a 3–1 defeat away to Tottenham Hotspur. With only 10 points from 31 games, they became the first team in Premier League history to go down with seven matches left to play, breaking the record shared by Derby County in 2007–08, Huddersfield Town in 2018–19 and Sheffield United in 2020–21, who were all relegated with six matches remaining (matchweek 32). The next day, the club announced that Ivan Jurić had left his role as manager after just 108 days in charge, having won only two games during his spell (one in the Premier League and one in the FA Cup). Simon Rusk took over as interim until the end of the season with Southampton midfielder Adam Lallana becoming Rusk's assistant.
On 7 April 2025, Leicester City set a record of eight consecutive home matches without scoring after their 3-0 defeat to Newcastle United.


== Teams ==
Twenty teams are competing in the league – the top seventeen teams from the previous season and the three teams promoted from the Championship. The promoted teams are Leicester City, Ipswich Town and Southampton. Leicester City and Southampton returned after one-year absences, while Ipswich Town returned after a twenty-two-year absence.
