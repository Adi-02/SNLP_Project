==== Unspecified projects ====
In addition, an unannounced film is scheduled to be released on June 18, 2027.


==== In-development projects ====
Additionally, Enrico Casarosa, Aphton Corbin, Kristen Lester, Domee Shi, and Rosana Sullivan have been working on their respective untitled feature films, all of which would be based upon original ideas.
In November 2023, creative director of the Cars franchise Jay Ward said he was working on multiple projects for the franchise.
In October 2024, Pixar was looking to cast Romani actors to voice two Romani characters for an unannounced film project.


=== Production cycle ===
In July 2013, thenâ€“Pixar president Edwin Catmull said that the studio planned to release one original film each year, and a sequel every other year, as part of a strategy to release "one and a half movies a year". On July 3, 2016, Pixar's current president Jim Morris announced that the studio might move away from sequels after Toy Story 4 and Pixar was only developing original ideas with five films in development at the time of the announcement.


=== Cancelled projects ===


==== Monkey ====
Back when Pixar was still a part of Lucasfilm in 1985, it started pre-production on a film called Monkey. After Pixar spun off as a new company in 1986, however, it was still working on it. In the end, Pixar abandoned the project due to technical limitations.


==== The Yellow Car ====
In 1995, Jorgen Klubien started writing a script for a film titled The Yellow Car. He wrote the first draft of the script with Joe Ranft. Then in 1998, the film was scrapped in favor of Toy Story 2 (1999). In 2001, The Yellow Car would eventually be reworked into Cars (2006).


==== 1906 ====
In 2005, Pixar began collaborating with Disney and Warner Bros. on a live-action film adaptation of James Dalessandro's novel 1906, with Brad Bird announced as the director. It would have marked Pixar's first involvement in a live-action production and its first collaboration with a major production company other than Disney. Disney and Pixar left the project due to script problems and an estimated budget of $200 million, and it is in limbo at Warner Bros. However, in June 2018, Bird mentioned the possibility of adapting the novel as a TV series, and the earthquake sequence as a live-action feature film.


==== Newt ====
A Pixar film titled Newt (which would have been Gary Rydstrom's feature directorial debut) was announced in April 2008, with Pixar planning to release it in 2011, which was later delayed to 2012, but it had finally been canceled by early 2010. John Lasseter noted that the film's proposed plot line was similar to another film, Blue Sky Studios' Rio (2011). In a March 2014 interview, then-Pixar president Edwin Catmull stated that Newt was an idea that was not working in pre-production. When the project was passed to Pete Docter, the director of Monsters, Inc. and Up, he pitched an idea that Pixar thought was better, and that concept became Inside Out.


==== ShadeMaker ====
In 2010, Henry Selick formed a joint venture with Pixar called Cinderbiter Productions, which was to exclusively produce stop-motion films. Its first project under the deal, a film titled ShadeMaker was set to be released on October 4, 2013, but was canceled in August 2012 due to creative differences. Selick was given the option to shop ShadeMaker (now titled The Shadow King) to other studios. Selick later stated in interviews that the film suffered from interference from John Lasseter who Selick claimed came in and constantly changed elements of the script and production that ended up raising the budget that would lead to its cancelation. By November 2022, it was announced that Selick had reacquired the rights for The Shadow King from Disney and that he might revive the project.


==== The Graveyard Book ====

In April 2012, Walt Disney Pictures acquired the rights and hired Henry Selick, director of The Nightmare Before Christmas and the film adaptation of Gaiman's novel Coraline, to direct The Graveyard Book. The film was moved to Pixar as a stop-motion production, which would have been the company's first adapted work. After the studio and Selick parted ways over scheduling and development, it was announced in January 2013 that Ron Howard would direct the film.
In July 2022, it was announced that Marc Forster would direct the adaptation with a screenplay by David Magee under Walt Disney Studios. Later that year, Neil Gaiman stated that he has no involvement with the film. In September 2024, it was reported that the production had been halted due to a variety of factors including sexual misconduct allegations against Gaiman.


==== Circle Seven Animation projects ====
In addition, when the now-defunct Circle Seven Animation was open, there were plans for sequels to Finding Nemo (for which Pixar made its own sequel, Finding Dory) and Monsters, Inc. (for which Pixar made a prequel, Monsters University), as well as a different version of Toy Story 3. Pixar's later sequels had no basis in Circle Seven's projects, and were created completely separately.


==== Other cancelled projects ====
Teddy Newton, Mark Andrews, Bob Peterson, Lee Unkrich, and Dan Scanlon worked on untitled original films that were shelved before their announcement. The screenplay for Newton's film was written by Derek Connolly. Andrews, Unkrich, and Scanlon left Pixar in 2018, 2019, and 2024, respectively. Unkrich later returned to Pixar by 2025 to helm Coco 2.
