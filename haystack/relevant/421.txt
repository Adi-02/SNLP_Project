The 2024–25 Premier League is the 33rd season of the Premier League and the 126th season of top-flight English football overall. The fixtures were released on 18 June 2024, consisting of 33 weekend rounds, four midweek rounds, and one Bank Holiday matchweek. The two-week winter break, in effect since the 2019–20 season, was scrapped starting this season in favour of a longer summer break for the players. Longer intervals between matches were added for the holiday period between Christmas and New Year's Day, with no matches held on Christmas Eve. The summer transfer window opened on 14 June 2024 and closed at 23:00 BST on 30 August 2024. The winter window opened on 1 January 2025 and closed at 23:00 GMT on 3 February 2025. This is also the last season the Nike sponsor match ball for the top flight is used, Puma are set to become the official ball supplier of the top flight from the 2025–26 season. This season will be the first to use semi-automated offside technology, as Premier League clubs unanimously agreed to its introduction. The technology was planned to be introduced after one of the autumn international breaks, but was delayed to further test the technology. It is now planned to be introduced to the Premier League later in the season after being tested in the FA Cup fifth round onwards. Manchester City entered the season as four-time defending champions, the first men's side to do so in the top flight of English football. == Season summary ==
The first managerial departure of the season came on 28 October 2024, when Manchester United sacked Erik ten Hag following a 2–1 defeat to West Ham United. The club sat in 14th place after nine games, having already suffered their fourth defeat of the season. Ruben Amorim was announced as his successor on 1 November and took charge on 11 November. Defending champions Manchester City suffered four successive league defeats, their worst run since 2008, as part of a winless run of seven matches in all competitions, including a 0–4 home loss to Tottenham Hotspur on 23 November 2024. The second managerial departure came on 24 November, when Leicester City sacked Steve Cooper following a 1–2 home loss to Chelsea. The club sat in 16th place at the time and one point above the relegation zone, having already suffered their sixth loss of the season and having managed only two wins from 12 games. On 29 November 2024, Leicester City announced the appointment of Ruud van Nistelrooy on a three-year deal. On 7 December 2024, the match between Everton and Liverpool was postponed due to adverse weather conditions as a result of Storm Darragh. The match was rearranged and played on 12 February 2025. On 15 December 2024, Wolverhampton Wanderers sacked head coach Gary O’Neil following a 1–2 home defeat to Ipswich Town. It was their 11th loss in 16 games; the club sat in 19th, four points from safety, having recorded only two wins. On the same day, bottom-side Southampton sacked Russell Martin after a 0–5 home defeat to Tottenham Hotspur. On 8 January 2025, West Ham United sacked Julen Lopetegui with the club sat in 14th place.

Twenty teams are competing in the league – the top seventeen teams from the previous season and the three teams promoted from the Championship. The promoted teams are Leicester City, Ipswich Town and Southampton. Leicester City and Southampton returned after one-year absences, while Ipswich Town returned after a twenty-two-year absence. They replaced Luton Town, Burnley and Sheffield United, who were all relegated to the Championship after just one year in the top flight, making this the first time since the 1997–98 season that all three promoted teams were relegated after just one season. === Stadiums and locations ==
