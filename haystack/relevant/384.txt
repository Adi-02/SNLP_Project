1,Val Kilmer,,5517198,,"A talented actor who was the youngest person admitted into Juilliard School, started his film career with the leading role in Top Secret! and emassed hits (Top Gun, Batman Forever, Heat) and acclaimed performances (The Doors, Tombstone, Kiss Kiss Bang Bang) even with a few flops and a reputation of being difficult to work with. His last film appearance on Top Gun: Maverick displayed Kilmer's biggest setback in life, a throat cancer that took his voice, and another respiratory issue caused his death as Kilmer died at 65 of a pneumonia." 2,Sikandar (2025 film),,1865547,,"Bollywood's latest hit, in spite of negative reviews, has Salman Khan as a Raja hunted by a politician seeking revenge." 3,Adolescence (TV series),,1396824,,"This British crime drama Netflix miniseries about a 13-year-old schoolboy named Jamie Miller (Owen Cooper) who is arrested for the murder of a girl in his school released all of its four episodes on March 13 which were each shot in one continuous take. It received critical acclaim for its directing, writing, and cinematography, with special attention paid to its atmosphere and performances." 4,ChatGPT,,1174872,,See #16 for the main reason why this is so high up on this week's report. 5,Richard Chamberlain,,1090281,,"One year after the acclaimed new adaptation of Shōgun, death came at the age of 90 for the star of the original one, known as ""King of the Miniseries"" for limited shows like that one and The Thorn Birds. Other notable roles for Chamberlain included Aramis in a trilogy of The Three Musketeers adaptations, Allan Quatermain in two movies heavily influenced by Indiana Jones, and the first portrayal of Jason Bourne." 6,A Minecraft Movie,,1082403,,"Minecraft is the best-selling video game of all time and formed the basis of the third video game adaptation starring Jack Black, whose reception is halfway between the hated Borderlands and the beloved The Super Mario Bros. Movie. Reviewers were unimpressed, as in spite of Black and Jason Momoa enjoying themselves critics considered only children and long-time players could properly like A Minecraft Movie. And with those two demographics attending the movie en masse, it opened to a massive opening weekend of $300 million worldwide." 7,Deaths in 2025,,1018476,,"From #1's last movie: To tell me you need me, I see that you're bleeding You don't need to show me again But if you decide to, I'll ride in this life with you I won't let go 'til the end..."
8,Joanne Whalley,,942756,,"#1's longest relationship was with this actress, who he met when they worked on Willow and is the mother of his two children, Mercedes and Jack (#18). Their divorce affected Kilmer while making the infamous The Island of Dr. Moreau, where his on-set behavior let director John Frankenheimer to declare ""There are two things I will never do in my life. I will never climb Mount Everest, and I will never work with Val Kilmer again. There is not enough money in the world.""" 9,L2: Empuraan,,926960,,"This Mollywood action thriller film, a sequel to the 2019 film Lucifer and the second instalment in the Lucifer trilogy was released on March 27 and managed to recover its budget of ₹180 crore (US$21 million) in just 4 days and break several records. It was jointly produced by Aashirvad Cinemas, Lyca Productions, and Sree Gokulam Movies, with Mohanlal reprising his role as the lead character." 10,Snow White (2025 film),,897714,,"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is widely considered one of the best animations ever made. Its live-action remake is nowhere near as acclaimed, and in fact seems to attract overblown hatred - the review bombing on IMDb made it the lowest rated movie ever until the website decided to disconsider the hundreds of thousands of low grades. An awful thing that doesn't end also plays a role, as the film's Snow White (#21) is unpopular for among other things having spoken in favor of Palestine, and the Evil Queen is downright demonized simply because she is Israeli. In any case, audiences aren't watching Snow White, and a damning demonstration is how in its third weekend the film was surpassed not only by #6 and #13 but by some theatrically released episodes of The Chosen!" 11,Cory Booker,,894618,,"On #15, this U.S. Senator from New Jersey broke the record for the longest speech in Senate history, surpassing Strom Thurmond's 24-hour-long filibuster against the Civil Rights Act of 1957. For about 25 hours straight, Booker spoke out against the disruptive actions of #25 and his senior advisor Elon Musk." 12,Natalia Grace,,891364,,"In 2010, it seemed like an American couple had watched Orphan and decided it was the way to get rid of their own Eastern European adoptive daughter with dwarfism (pictured here in a documentary), leaving her alone in an apartment while telling others she was also a sociopathic adult woman pretending to be a child. But it was all a neglectful lie, leading the couple to get criminal charges and this weird story to be told in a Hulu show (#23)." 13,A Working Man,,783636,,"Jason Statham is a former Royal Marine Commando working at a construction site, who after his boss's daughter is kidnapped goes to her rescue, leaving behind a trail of death and destruction. It barely strays from Statham's other action movies and thus has done well at the box office, having already covered its $40 million budget in spite of middling reviews." 14,The White Lotus season 3,,782755,,"HBO aired the season finale for this, that caused controversy for an incestuous story and somehow delayed the death that happens once a season to the last episode." 15,April Fools' Day,,660516,,April Fools! 16,Studio Ghibli,,648843,,"Even those who never watched an anime in their lives were seeing online people using #4 to turn images into pastiches of this famed Japanese studio, whose catalogue includes two Oscar winners (Spirited Away and The Boy and the Heron) and other acclaimed movies such as My Neighbor Totoro, Princess Mononoke, and Ponyo. Founder Hayao Miyazaki doesn't have nice things to say about AI art." 17,The White Lotus,,635542,,#14 is the latest in this show about bad things happening in a resort hotel. Location scouting for the next season has already started. 18,Jack Kilmer,,620899,,"#1 and #8's son also went into acting, with roles in movies such as The Nice Guys and Lords of Chaos. Jack also narrates a documentary built out of decades of homemade footage filmed by his father, Val, being his voice as he barely had it anymore (a few scenes have Val speaking with much effort after covering the tracheotomy hole in his neck)." 19,Laura Loomer,,592310,,"The perpetuator of the Springfield pet-eating hoax in September returned to #25's side to tell him that several members of the U.S. National Security Council were disloyal to his regime. Council adviser Michael Waltz arrived late to the meeting to witness Loomer's litany of names, to which President and council chairman Trump ordered those people in question to be fired." 20,Bob Dylan,,560678,,"A Complete Unknown entered Hulu on March 27, so the second screen purpose of Wikipedia lets people search more on its subject, music legend Bob Dylan. The movie has Timothée Chalamet portraying Dylan in the 1960s, from when he arrived in New York City until a controversial concert where people complained about electric instruments being played in a folk festival." 21,Rachel Zegler,,550672,,"Yes, the Jersey-born leading actress of #10 is of Latin descent. Yes, she supports Palestine. However, Zegler received additional negative press following Snow White's release when producer Marc Platt's son publicly blamed her comments for the film's slow inability to recoup its budget (it's one of Disney's many entries on the most expensive films list, and currently bound to join the biggest flops one)." 22,MobLand,,550180,,"Paramount+ started this show that would be a prequel to Ray Donovan only to be reworked into its own crime story, starring Tom Hardy as a fixer." 23,Good American Family,,541843,,"The more dramatized story of #12 (starring Ellen Pompeo, pictured) premiered on Hulu on March 19 and airs until April 30. It was the platform's most-watched title on March 25." 24,Severance (TV series),,515582,,"This science fiction psychological thriller Apple TV+ series had its season 2 finale, which concluded with a cliffhanger; it'd been renewed for a season 3 on the same day as finale. Ben Stiller who executive produced and primarily directed the series revealed that the third season won't take as long as the second season did as the second season's production was heavily delayed due to the 2023 Hollywood labor disputes." 25,Donald Trump,,496320,,"Well, look who's back. It's time for yet another round of WDDD. Let's catch up with what we missed these past two weeks. Last week, President Trump attempted to overhaul the U.S. electoral process and reiterated his desire to buy Greenland by sending several members of his cabinet there. Most concerningly, Trump said that he was ""not joking"" when he said he was considering to run for an unconstitutional third term and that there are ""methods which you could do it"" (the only method would be to pass a constitutional amendment allowing him to run again, but that would require the support of some Democratic states). The biggest news of this week regarded new tariffs on all goods brought into the U.S., causing an immediate stock market crash and bear market. A breakdown on the tariffs lead to the much mocked discovery that one of the locations hit by taxes is Heard Island and McDonald Islands, a distant archipelago that isn't inhabited by humans, but by penguins! I guess we all can be a little (unusually expensive) nuts sometimes." The World Happiness Report is a publication that contains articles and rankings of national happiness, based on respondent ratings of their own lives, which the report also correlates with various (quality of) life factors. Since 2024, the report has been published by the Wellbeing Research Centre at the University of Oxford, in partnership with Gallup, the UN Sustainable Development Solutions Network, and an independent editorial board. The editorial board consists of the three founding editors, John F. Helliwell, Richard Layard, and Jeffrey D. Sachs, along with Jan-Emmanuel De Neve, Lara Aknin, and Shun Wang. The report primarily uses data from the Gallup World Poll. As of March 2025, Finland has been ranked the happiest country in the world eight years in a row. == History ==
In July 2011, the UN General Assembly adopted resolution 65/309 Happiness: Towards a Holistic Definition of Development, inviting member countries to measure the happiness of their people and to use the data to help guide public policy. The first World Happiness Report was released on 1 April 2012, as a foundational text for the UN High Level Meeting: Well-being and Happiness: Defining a New Economic Paradigm, drawing international attention. On 2 April 2012, this was followed by the first UN High Level Meeting called Wellbeing and Happiness: Defining a New Economic Paradigm, which was chaired by UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, in addition to that Prime Minister Jigmi Thinley of Bhutan, a nation that adopted gross national happiness instead of gross domestic product as their main development indicator. The first report outlined the state of world happiness, causes of happiness and misery, and policy implications highlighted by case studies. In 2013, the second World Happiness Report was issued, and in 2015 the third. Since 2016, it has been issued on an annual basis on 20 March, to coincide with the UN's International Day of Happiness. == Methods and philosophy ==
The rankings of national happiness are based on a happiness measurement survey undertaken world-wide by the polling company Gallup, Inc. Nationally representative samples of respondents are asked to think of a ladder, with the best possible life for them being a 10, and the worst possible life being a 0. They are then asked to rate their own current lives on that 0 to 10 scale. The report correlates the life evaluation results with various life factors. The life factor variables used in the reports are reflective of determinants that explain national-level differences in life evaluations across research literature. However, certain variables, such as unemployment or inequality, are not considered because comparable data is not yet available across all countries. The variables used illustrate important correlations rather than causal estimates. The use of subjective measurements of wellbeing is meant to be a bottom-up approach which emancipates respondents to evaluate their own wellbeing. In this context, the value of the "Cantril ladder" is the fact that a respondent can self-anchor themselves based on their perspective. In the reports, experts in fields including economics, psychology, survey analysis, and national statistics, describe how measurements of well-being can be used effectively to assess the progress of nations, and other topics. Each report is organized by chapters that delve deeper into issues relating to happiness, including mental illness, the objective benefits of happiness, the importance of ethics, policy implications, and links with the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development's (OECD) approach to measuring subjective well-being and other international and national efforts. === WELLBYs ===

From 2021 the World Happiness Report has advocated for the use of WELLBYs (Well-Being-Adjusted Life-Years); it argues that QALYs only count the individual patient's health-related quality of life, and instead WELLBYs should be used. Policy-makers should aim to maximize the WELLBYs of all who are born, and also include the WELLBYs of future generations (subject to a small discount rate). == Happiness of the young and old ==
Country rankings for the young and the old are quite different, and systematically so, underscoring the fact that convergence between the two halves of Europe has been driven mainly by the rising happiness of the young. Countries ranking highest for the old are generally countries with high overall rankings, but include several where the young have recently fared very poorly. == Annual report topics ==

The World Happiness Report has been published every year since 2012 (except for 2014). In addition to ranking countries’ happiness and well-being levels, each report has contributing authors and most focus on a particular theme. The data used to rank countries in each report is drawn from the Gallup World Poll, as well as other sources such as the World Values Survey, in some of the reports. The Gallup World Poll questionnaire measures 14 areas within its core questions: (1) business & economic, (2) citizen engagement, (3) communications & technology, (4) diversity (social issues), (5) education & families, (6) emotions (well-being), (7) environment & energy, (8) food & shelter, (9) government and politics, (10) law & order (safety), (11) health, (12) religion & ethics, (13) transportation, and (14) work. === 2024 World Happiness Report ===

== International rankings ==
Data is collected from people in over 150 countries. Each variable measured reveals a populated-weighted average score on a scale running from 0 to 10 that is tracked over time and compared against other countries. These variables currently include:

real GDP per capita
social support
healthy life expectancy
freedom to make life choices
generosity
perceptions of corruption
Each country is also compared against a hypothetical nation called Dystopia. Dystopia represents the lowest national averages for each key variable and is, along with residual error, used as a regression benchmark. The six metrics are used to explain the estimated extent to which each of these factors contribute to increasing life satisfaction when compared to the hypothetical nation of Dystopia, but they themselves do not have an effect on the total score reported for each country. === 2025 report ===

=== Metrics ===
Critics have pointed out the difference between evaluations and experiences of well-being. For instance Colombia came 37th in the 2018 World Happiness Report rankings but first by daily emotional experience in Gallup's Positive Experience Index. The inconsistencies in the results of different happiness measurement surveys have also been noted, for instance, a Pew survey of 43 countries in 2014 (which excluded most of Europe) had Mexico, Israel, and Venezuela finishing first, second and third. Others point out that the variables of interest used by the World Happiness Report are more appropriate for measuring national-level rather than individual-level happiness. === Methodology ===
The World Happiness Report's use of a single-item indicator of subjective well-being is fundamentally different from more traditional Index approaches which use a range of indicators such as the United Nations' Human Development Index, the OECD Better Life Index of 2011, or the Social Progress Index of 2013. There has also been an ongoing debate regarding single-item and multi-item scales as measures of life satisfaction. The idea that subjective well-being can be captured by a survey has also been contested by economists, who have identified that people’s assessments of their happiness can be affected by how, for example, their country’s education system grades exams, and that survey questions on subjective well-being are affected by response styles. === Legitimacy ===
In 2014, British journalist Michael Booth questioned the legitimacy of the Nordic countries' freedom and happiness rankings in his book The Almost Nearly Perfect People. In it, he criticizes Denmark's environmental footprint and notes that the taxes and personal debt levels among its citizens are the highest in the world. He also writes that in Finland, the most common type of prescription medications in the country are antipsychotic. He also points out the country's high alcohol consumption, murder, and suicide rates. Further, he argues that he doesn't think the Danes were the world's happiest people, but instead described them as the "most satisfied". =
