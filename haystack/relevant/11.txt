The 2024 ICC Men's T20 World Cup was the ninth edition of the ICC Men's T20 World Cup, co-hosted by Cricket West Indies and USA Cricket from 1 to 29 June 2024. It was the first major ICC tournament to include matches played in the United States. The West Indies had previously hosted the 2010 competition. A total of twenty teams competed in 55 matches across six venues in the West Indies, and three in the United States.
The number of participants was increased from sixteen to twenty teams, including the two hosts, the top eight teams from the 2022 edition, the two highest-ranked teams in the ICC Men's T20I Team Rankings not already qualified, and eight other teams determined through regional qualifiers. Canada and Uganda qualified for the men's T20 World Cup for the first time; and the United States participated for the first time by virtue of being co-hosts.
England were the defending champions and were beaten in the semi-finals by India, who went on to win their second T20 World Cup title, defeating South Africa by seven runs in the final. India won all their matches, and were the first team to win a T20 World Cup undefeated. They joined England and West Indies as the only teams to win the title twice.


== Background ==
The ICC Men's T20 World Cup is a biennial world cup for cricket in Twenty20 International (T20I) format, organised by the International Cricket Council (ICC), and 2024 was the ninth edition. It was first played in 2007 in South Africa. The eighth edition, held in 2022 in Australia, was contested by 16 teams, and was won by England, who defeated Pakistan in the final.


=== Host selection ===
In November 2021, as part of the 2024–2031 ICC men's hosts cycle, the ICC announced that the 2024 Men's T20 World Cup would be played in the West Indies and the United States. A joint bid was submitted by Cricket West Indies and USA Cricket following two years of preparation, forming part of a strategic partnership between the two associations.
USA Cricket's co-hosting was part of efforts to help develop and promote cricket in the United States, where the sport's fanbase is primarily made up of South Asian Americans. Prior to this World Cup, the United States had occasionally hosted West Indies home matches at Central Broward Park in Florida, while a T20 franchise league known as Major League Cricket launched in 2023.
Although cricket had never become mainstream in the country, the United States is associated with several notable developments in the early history of the game, including having hosted Canada in the first international cricket match, and American cricketer Bart King having been credited with developing the technique of swing bowling.


=== Format ===
The 20 qualifying teams were divided into four groups of five teams; the teams played each of the other four in their group—a total of ten matches per group—and the top two teams in each group advanced to the Super 8 stage. The advanced teams were divided into two groups of four teams based on pre-tournament seedings; the teams played each of the other three in that group—a total of six matches per group—and the top two teams in each advanced group advanced to the knockout stage.
Prior to the tournament, the ICC announced the eight seeded teams for the Super 8 stage based on their T20I rankings ahead of the tournament. On advancing from the group stage, they were placed in pre-determined positions in the Super 8 stage, irrespective of their position in the group stage. If an unseeded team qualified at the expense of a seeded team, it took the position of the corresponding seeded team that failed to qualify from the group.


=== Schedule ===
The month of June 2024 was allocated to the tournament on the 2023–2027 ICC Men's Future Tours Programme. On 28 July 2023, ESPNcricinfo reported that the tournament would be played from 4 to 30 June 2024. The finalized schedule was announced on 5 January 2024, with the tournament scheduled to take place from 1 to 29 June. The teams played 55 matches with three cities in the United States hosting 12 matches and the rest of the matches hosted by six venues in the Caribbean. On 16 May 2024, the ICC announced that warm-up fixtures would be held from 27 May to 1 June.

=== Marketing ===
The ICC hosted a trophy tour before the tournament which began on 19 March in New York and the trophy was taken to various locations around the world.

In May 2023, Cricket West Indies (CWI) began a bidding process for countries in the Caribbean region willing to host the matches of the World Cup. In July 2023, the ICC shortlisted four venues in the United States: Central Broward Park in Lauderhill, Florida; Church Street Park in Morrisville, North Carolina; Grand Prairie Stadium in Grand Prairie, Texas; and a temporary stadium at Van Cortlandt Park in the Bronx, New York City, for hosting the matches. Residents of the Bronx objected to the Van Cortlandt Park stadium, citing that it would restrict public access to the park for an extended time, expressing concerns for its environmental impact, and questioning the economic viability of the event. On 20 September 2023, the ICC announced that Grand Prairie, Lauderhill, and New York would be the three U.S. host cities, with a 34,000-seat temporary stadium to be constructed at Eisenhower Park on Long Island in Nassau County, New York. Central Broward Park and Grand Prairie Stadium were to be expanded, with temporary grandstands and hospitality areas doubling their capacity during the tournament.
On 22 September 2023, ICC announced that venues in Antigua and Barbuda, Barbados, Guyana, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, and Trinidad and Tobago would serve as the hosts in the West Indies.Grenada, Jamaica, and Saint Kitts and Nevis did not submit bids to host the World Cup, with Jamaican sports minister Olivia Grange ruling out a bid on cost grounds. In November 2023, it was announced that Trinidad's Queen's Park Oval, the country's primary cricket venue, would not be hosting any World Cup matches and that fixtures would be moved to the Brian Lara Cricket Academy in San Fernando. Nigel Camacho, the president of the Queen's Park Cricket Club, stated that the venue would instead most likely host warm-up matches before the start of the main tournament. The Government of Dominica decided to withdraw its venue, Windsor Park, from hosting any matches of the World Cup, citing its inability to complete the infrastructural development of the venue before the tournament commenced.
In December 2023, a delegation of representatives from the ICC undertook an inspection of the confirmed host venues in the Caribbean and the United States, so as to finalise the fixtures for the tournament. The New York stadium was slated to host the India–Pakistan group stage match, considered one of the sport's strongest rivalries. On 17 January 2024, the ICC unveiled the proposed design of the temporary New York stadium—Nassau County International Cricket Stadium—which was completed in May 2024 in time for the tournament. It marked the first temporary venue to have ever been used during an ICC World Cup.


== Squads ==

Each team was allowed to have a squad of 15 players with the provisional squad required to be submitted to the ICC by 1 May 2024. The teams were allowed to make changes to their squads till 25 May. On 29 April 2024, New Zealand was the first team to announce its squad for the tournament. The following day, Afghanistan, England, India, Oman and South Africa announced their squads; followed by Australia and Nepal on 1 May; Canada on 2 May; co-hosts West Indies and the United States on 3 May; Scotland and Uganda on 6 May; Ireland and Papua New Guinea on 7 May; Sri Lanka on 9 May; Namibia on 10 May; Netherlands on 13 May; and Bangladesh on 14 May. Pakistan became the final team to announce their squad for the tournament on 24 May.

Disney Star handled the global broadcasting rights as part of their deal with the ICC. After having introduced smartphone-oriented vertical video broadcasts at the 2023 Cricket World Cup using dedicated camera feeds, the vertical video feeds for this T20 World Cup shifted to using machine learning technology to automatically adapt the main 16:9 camera feeds to vertical and square video formats. The ICC also offered highlights from the Super 8 round onward through an immersive app for visionOS, allowing users to view presentations from various areas of the stadium.
In an effort to help promote the sport to U.S. audiences, the ICC partnered with American sports podcaster Jomboy, who has been known for producing cricket-related content targeting baseball viewers—as a contributor, including making guest appearances as an analyst on selected matches to help explain the rules and strategy of the sport to new viewers.
