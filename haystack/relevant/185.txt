The following is a list of notable sports stadiums, ordered by their capacity, which refers to the maximum number of spectators they can normally accommodate.


== List criteria notes ==
The capacity figures are standard, permanent total capacity, including both seating and any permanent standing areas, but excluding any temporary accommodation.
Incidental record attendance is not considered relevant. Only regular capacity counts; for attendance records, see List of sporting venues with a highest attendance of 100,000 or more.
Only stadiums with a capacity of 40,000 or more are included in this list.
Stadiums that are defunct or closed, or those that no longer serve as competitive sports venues (such as Great Strahov Stadium, which was the largest in the world and held around 250,000 spectators), are not included. They are listed under List of closed stadiums by capacity.
An asterisk (*) indicates that the team plays only some (few) of its home matches at the venue, and may have another (primary) home ground.
For purposes of this list, race tracks (such as the Indianapolis Motor Speedway and the Tokyo Racecourse) are not stadiums, and are not included here. For a list of all sports venues by capacity, see List of sports venues by capacity.
Capacities are taken whenever possible from the figure stated on the official website of a stadium, its tenants, or sports event it has hosted.
