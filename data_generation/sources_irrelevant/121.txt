The foreign policy of the second Donald Trump administration has been described as imperialist and expansionist in its approach to the Americas, and isolationist in its approach to Europe, espousing a realist "America First" foreign policy agenda. It was characterized as a 'hardline' version of the Monroe Doctrine. 
Trump's administration was described as breaking the post-1945 rules-based liberal international order and abandoning multilateralism. Trump's relations with U.S. allies have been transactional and ranged from indifference to hostility, while he has sought friendlier relations with certain U.S. adversaries. The administration is generally opposed to international cooperation on areas such as the environment, global health, or the economy, which it views as against the national interest; it seeks to reduce or end foreign aid, and to change relationships and policies accordingly.
Trump started a trade war with Canada and Mexico and continued the ongoing trade war with China. He repeatedly said he wants to annex Canada, Greenland, and the Panama Canal. He has taken a hardline pro-Israel stance. In response to the Gaza War, he proposes taking over the Gaza Strip, forcibly relocating the Palestinian population to other Arab states, and rebuilding Gaza into a tourist resort. Trump has sought realignment with Vladimir Putin's Russia, a longtime adversary of the U.S. To end the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Trump's administration offered concessions to Russia; it also said that Ukraine bore partial responsibility for the invasion. These moves have been criticized by most of the United States' allies and by many international organizations.
Trump's foreign policy has been described as "realist" and is likened to the foreign policy of former president William McKinley.


== Early actions ==
Within his first week in office in January 2025, President Donald Trump signed several executive orders reflecting the priorities of his administration. These included Executive Order 14147, directing agencies to identify and eliminate politically motivated conduct; Executive Order 14148, rescinding executive actions from the previous administration; and Executive Order 14149, prohibiting the use of federal resources for censorship and directing a review of past government communication policies. He also declared a national energy emergency to boost domestic production (Executive Order 14156); initiated withdrawal from the Paris Agreement (Executive Order 14162); and signed Executive Order 14160, which aimed to challenge the current interpretation of birthright citizenship under the 14th Amendment. Additional actions included reinstating the name "Mount McKinley" (Executive Order 14172); and issuing guidance to combat antisemitism in educational institutions and federal agencies (Executive Order 14188).

== Africa ==


=== Democratic Republic of the Congo ===

Secretary of State Marco Rubio condemned the Rwandan–backed Goma offensive in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, affirming that the U.S. supports the Congolese sovereignty in a phone call with DRC President Félix Tshisekedi. Rubio called for an immediate ceasefire on January 28, 2025, after a phone conversation with Rwanda President Paul Kagame, and for all parties to respect sovereign territorial integrity.


=== Lesotho ===

Trump in March 2025 said that the United States had previously spent $8 million "to promote LGBTQI+ in the African nation of Lesotho, which nobody has ever heard of".


=== South Africa ===

On February 6, 2025, Secretary of State Rubio announced that he would not attend the G20 summit in Johannesburg, citing South Africa's "controversial land expropriation law" as one of his reasons. The following day, President Trump issued an Executive Order to suspend any aid or assistance to South Africa, citing South Africa's expropriation law which allegedly discriminated against Afrikaners.
In response, South African Department of International Relations and Cooperation spokesperson Chrispin Phiri denounced the decision, saying it was insensitive towards South Africa's historical experience with colonialism and Apartheid and added it was based on misinformation and propaganda." During his annual State of the Nation Address, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa reiterated that South Africa "will not be intimidated or pushed around." In early February 2025, Reuters reported that Errol Musk had arranged a phone call between Ramaphosa and Trump ally Elon Musk in response to the suspension of US aid to South Africa. 
In early March 2025, Ramaphosa issued a statement rejecting "counterproductive megaphone diplomacy" after Trump published a social media post reiterating his earlier claim that South Africa was confiscating land from farmers. 
Later in March 2025, the Trump administration declared South African Ambassador Ebrahim Rasool persona non grata, ordering him to leave the U.S. by March 21. The decision, announced by Marco Rubio on social media before formal notification, followed remarks Rasool made in a webinar criticizing U.S. policies. South Africa objected to the manner of the expulsion, accusing the U.S. of bypassing diplomatic channels, while Ramaphosa downplayed the issue, calling it a "hiccup" in U.S.-South Africa relations.


== Americas ==


=== Argentina ===

On November 14, 2024, Argentine president Javier Milei headed to Florida to meet with Trump at Mar-a-Lago. He was the first foreign head of state to travel to the United States after Trump's victory and to meet the president-elect. Milei, an economist known for his advocacy of free-market policies and limited government, had previously expressed support for Donald Trump and his political positions, wanting to strengthen diplomatic and economic ties between Argentina and the Western world. In a call following the election results, Trump called Milei his "favorite president" in response according to reports. The president of Argentina gave a speech at a CPAC summit in Miami. Milei also met with Department of Government Efficiency planned-directors Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy to advise them on their goal to "dismantle bureaucracy", cut government spending and reorganize the federal personnel.


=== Brazil ===

Former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro was reportedly invited to attend the inauguration; however, Brazil's Supreme Court barred him from traveling to the United States due to ongoing legal investigations and the seizure of his passport. Justice Alexandre de Moraes ruled that Bolsonaro did not hold an official position and posed a potential flight risk. Bolsonaro had filed an appeal in an attempt to attend the event, which was denied.

=== Canada ===

On March 4, 2025, President Donald Trump imposed a 25% tariff on all Canadian imports, excluding energy products, which were subjected to a 10% tariff. According to the administration, the goal was to reduce the U.S. trade deficit and encourage stronger Canadian border enforcement, particularly regarding illegal immigration and fentanyl trafficking. Supporters of the policy also cited high Canadian tariffs on U.S. agricultural goods—such as tariffs of up to 240% on dairy and 150% on poultry and eggs—as evidence of a trade imbalance.
In response, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced 25% tariffs on $30 billion worth of U.S. goods, with an additional $125 billion in tariffs planned for the following weeks. Trudeau criticized the U.S. tariffs as unjustified and economically damaging, encouraging Canadians to support domestic products and services.


==== Annexation Remarks ====

President Trump has referred to Canada as a "state" and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau as the "Governor" since meeting with Trudeau at Mar-a-Lago in late November 2024. In a January press conference, Trump said he was considering annexing Canada by economic force. Trump has threatened and paused tariffs on Canadian goods repeatedly since taking office, and suggested Canada could avoid tariffs by becoming the 51st U.S. state, a notion he has reiterated on multiple occasions. Initially dismissed as jest, these comments have since been taken seriously by Canadian officials. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau expressed concerns that Trump's annexation ambitions might be driven by a desire to access Canada's mineral resources, emphasizing the importance of safeguarding Canadian sovereignty. In additional, Trump mentioned in official diplomatic communication that he wants to challenge the Treaty of 1908 that established the Canada–United States border.


==== Decoupling Canada–American ties ====
In 2025, U.S. President Donald Trump's foreign policy, characterized by protectionist measures and strained alliances, led Canada to reassess its defense partnerships. In response to trade disputes and perceived threats to sovereignty, Prime Minister Mark Carney initiated discussions with the European Union to reduce reliance on U.S. military equipment. These talks included exploring the procurement of European-made fighter jets, such as Sweden's Saab Gripen, with proposals for domestic assembly in Canada. Defense Minister Bill Blair was tasked with reviewing the existing contract for 88 American F-35 fighter jets, considering alternatives that could bolster Canada's domestic defense industry and diversify its international partnerships. This strategic pivot reflects Canada's broader effort to assert autonomy and strengthen ties with European allies amid uncertainties in traditional North American defense relationships.


=== Chile ===

During Trump's second administration, U.S. foreign policy in Latin America is focused on countering China's influence in the region, particularly in the context of strategic trade infrastructure. A notable example is the emphasis placed on strengthening ties with Chile, specifically through potential investments in the modernization of the Port of San Antonio in Valparaíso. This initiative was framed as a strategic counterbalance to the Chinese-financed megaproject at the Port of Chancay in Peru. U.S. investors, facilitated by the Development Finance Corporation, were set to visit Chile to assess opportunities for technological and infrastructural development. Meanwhile, reports suggested that the Trump administration considered imposing tariffs of up to 60% on goods exported from the Chancay port, reflecting its broader strategy to support allies like Chile in the face of China's expanding footprint in Latin America. These developments occurred amidst high-level diplomatic engagements between Chilean and U.S. officials, underscoring shared interests in enhancing Pacific trade networks.
Trump appointed Brandon Judd as the United States ambassador to Chile. Judd was a member of the United States Border Patrol, serving as president of the National Border Patrol Council union, and is a supporter of building the border wall. In 2025, Chile has an illegal immigration crisis.


=== Colombia ===

In January 2025, a diplomatic dispute arose between Colombia and the United States after Colombian President Gustavo Petro denied landing permission to two U.S. military-chartered flights carrying deported Colombian nationals. The flights, each with approximately 80 individuals, consisted primarily of Colombian citizens with criminal records or convictions in the United States, according to U.S. immigration authorities. While U.S. officials stated that Colombian authorities had been notified of the flights, the Colombian government described them as uncoordinated and unauthorized.
In response, President Trump imposed emergency 25% tariffs on all Colombian imports, introduced travel bans and visa revocations for Colombian government officials, and ordered enhanced inspections of Colombian cargo and travelers. He warned that tariffs would rise to 50% if deportation refusals continued. Following negotiations, Colombia agreed to resume acceptance of deportees. As part of the agreement, the U.S. committed to revised deportation protocols — including no handcuffing or photographing of returnees and the use of civilian rather than military escorts — while Colombia arranged for its own air force to conduct future retrievals.


=== Cuba ===

In one of his first acts of his second administration, President Trump reinstated Cuba as a state sponsors of terrorism, reversing an action made by President Biden in the weeks prior in exchange for political prisoners. He also restored a list of "restricted entities" established during his first administration. President Miguel Díaz-Canel referred to the moves as "an act of arrogance and disregard for truth."
Later in January 2025, Trump announced he would use the Guantanamo Bay detention camp as a holding facility for up to 30,000 criminal migrants amidst his administration's efforts of mass deportation across the United States. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth specified that the facility would be run by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and will be used as "temporary transit" in order to "humanely move illegals...back to the countries where they came from in a proper process." Flights carrying migrants to Guantanamo began on February 4, with the first consisting of 10 suspected members of Tren de Aragua out of El Paso, Texas.


=== Mexico ===

On March 4, 2025, the United States imposed 25% tariffs on Mexican goods. Part of these tariffs are lifted for a month on March 6 after a telephone conversation between Trump and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum. 
During the first months of 2025, Mexico stepped up its fight against narcotraffic and immigration following Trump's statements on the subject. In particular, Mexico handed over 29 major cartel prisoners to US authorities in February 2025.


=== Panama ===

On March 4, 2025, President Donald Trump reiterated his intention to reassert U.S. control over the Panama Canal, alleging that Panama had violated the longstanding neutrality agreement governing its operation.
In response, Panamanian President José Raúl Mulino dismissed the remarks as false and offensive to Panama’s sovereignty.
On the same day, Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison Holdings announced plans to sell its operational rights to the Balboa and Cristóbal ports, located at either end of the Panama Canal, to a consortium led by the American investment firm BlackRock.


=== Venezuela ===

== Asia ==


=== China ===

Just before Trump's second inauguration, Vice President Vance and ally Elon Musk each held separate meetings with China's vice president Han Zheng, who was in Washington attending the event as China's president Xi Jinping's special representative. Han's presence at the event was seen by commentators as representative of Xi's interest in strengthening China–United States relations under Trump's tenure.
China has supported Trump's efforts to end the war in Ukraine.
During his 2024 presidential campaign, Trump advocated for a stringent stance against China, proposing tariffs as high as 60% on Chinese goods. However, upon assuming office, he implemented a more modest 10% tariff on Chinese imports, while imposing tariffs on goods from traditional allies such as Canada and Mexico.  Critics argue that this approach has inadvertently facilitated China's expanding influence in Europe and the Global South. By alienating key U.S. allies through aggressive trade policies, the administration has created opportunities for China to strengthen its economic and diplomatic ties in these regions, potentially at the expense of U.S. strategic interests.
Under the directive published by the U.S. State Department in 2025, the Chinese leader should be referred to as “General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party”, rather than “President of China” reflecting the supremacy of the CCP over China.
In February 2025, the US State Department website was changed to state that China was trying to "subvert" international organizations and install Chinese Communist Party members in leadership positions. A spokesperson of the Foreign Ministry of China responded that these changes were inaccurate and that they "deplore" the changes.
In March 2025, foreign ministers from Japan, China, and South Korea convened in Tokyo to enhance regional cooperation amid escalating global uncertainty. U.S. President Donald Trump's foreign policy, characterized by unilateralism and protectionist trade measures, has strained traditional alliances and prompted East Asian nations to seek closer collaboration among themselves. The meeting addressed shared challenges such as demographic decline, environmental concerns, and economic coordination. However, significant divisions persist, particularly regarding China's support for North Korea and Russia, and its broader regional assertiveness.


=== India ===

Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi have pledged to deepen the U.S.-India partnership. On February 13, 2025, Modi became the fourth world leader to visit Donald Trump at the White House. During the meeting, Modi praised the MAGA movement and said that "Borrowing an expression from the US, our vision for a developed India is to 'Make India Great Again', or MIGA. When America and India work together, when it's MAGA plus MIGA, it becomes mega – a mega partnership for prosperity."
India rejected Trump's offer to mediate India-China tensions.


=== Japan ===

Trump in March 2025 lamented that Japan is making "a fortune with [the United States] economically" while the U.S.–Japan Security Treaty requires the United States to "protect" Japan, but Japan does not have to "protect" the United States, so Trump "asked who makes these deals?" Also that month, Trump said that he "called the leaders of Japan to say you can't continue to reduce and break down your currency ... it's unfair ... And the way you solve it very easily is with tariffs."


=== South Korea ===

Trump in March 2025 said, without providing evidence, that "South Korea's average tariff [on the United States] is four times higher" than the United States' average tariff on South Korea, while also highlighting that the United States "give so much help militarily and in so many other ways to South Korea".


== Europe ==

During his election campaign, Trump said that European allies "treat us actually worse than our so-called enemies". He added, "We protect them and then they screw us on trade. We're not going to let it happen anymore". He vowed to impose tariffs on trade partners including those in Europe, which economists said could spark trade wars.
Trump said he would not defend NATO allies in Europe if they did not meet the alliance's target of spending 2% of GDP on defense, and instead he would "encourage" Russia to "do whatever the hell they want".
On February 2, 2025, Russian President Vladimir Putin supported Trump and ridiculed European leaders, whom he calls "minnows" (Russian: мелюзга), stating the following:

Trump, with his character, with his persistence, he'll put things in order there pretty quickly. And all of them, you'll see, it will happen quickly, all of them will stand at the feet of their master and wave their tails gently. Everything will fall into place.

On February 14, 2025, U.S. Vice President JD Vance addressed the Munich Security Conference, asserting that Europe's primary threats are internal, citing perceived erosions in free speech and democratic values. He criticized European leaders for suppressing dissenting opinions and ignoring public concerns on issues like immigration. Vance highlighted incidents such as the annulment of Romania's presidential election due to alleged foreign interference and legal actions against individuals in the UK and Sweden for expressing conservative views as evidence of this trend. He also challenged Germany's political isolation of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, advocating for greater political inclusivity. European officials, including German Defence Minister Boris Pistorius, rebuffed Vance's remarks, deeming them unacceptable and misaligned with the conference's focus on external security threats like Russia and China.  The speech intensified transatlantic tensions, prompting discussions among European leaders about reducing reliance on U.S. support.
During the 2020s, there was a significant shift in European defense policy, particularly accelerating in 2025 due to geopolitical policy shifts during Donald Trump's second presidency. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte announced during the 61st Munich Security Conference that alliance members would need to increase their military spending to "considerably more than 3 percent" of their national GDP. This statement came in response to calls from the Trump administration for members to reach 5% of GDP in defence expenditure. On March 2, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer hosted the 2025 London Summit on Ukraine with 18 world leaders, in order to coordinate support for Ukraine during the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The summit followed a meeting between Zelenskyy and Trump at the White House in Washington on February 28, 2025. On March 4, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen proposed ReArm Europe, a five-point plan to boost defence spending by up to €800 billion, including €150 billion in loans to EU member states. This came a day after Trump halted all military aid to Ukraine.


=== Denmark and Greenland ===
In January 2025, President Trump stated that he wished to buy Greenland from Denmark, or, take Greenland by force for national security purposes.
During his March 4th address to Congress, Trump vowed the United States would gain control over Greenland "one way or another." A subsequent public opinion poll showed that 85% of Greenlanders were opposed to joining the US.  Also in March 2025, amid rocketing wholesale egg prices in the United States due to bird flu reducing egg supply, the Trump administration asked the Danish Egg Association to check how many eggs could they export to the United States.
In a first for a sitting American vice president, JD Vance in March 2025 visited Greenland. There, Vance said regarding Trump: "We can't just ignore the president's desires" for the United States to acquire Greenland, while warning that Greenland faced the "encroachment of powerful countries" China and Russia "as they expand their ambitions". In a "message to Denmark", Vance declared, "you have not done a good job", accusing Denmark of having "underinvested in the security architecture" and "people of Greenland".


=== France ===

A month after the election, Trump traveled to Paris to attend the reopening of Notre-Dame de Paris on December 7, five years after it was severely damaged by a fire. It was his first foreign trip as president-elect since his second electoral victory. He met with a number of world leaders ahead of the ceremony, including French president Emmanuel Macron, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and Prince William of the United Kingdom.


=== Germany ===

In February 2025, Vice President JD Vance visited the leader of the far-right German political party Alternative for Germany and expressed support for lifting restrictions on the party.
In March 2025, presumptive German Chancellor Friedrich Merz proposed a significant increase in defense spending in Germany, justifying his policy by the "rapidly changing situation", especially after the clash between Trump and Zelenskyy in the White House. German lawmakers approved an  amendment to the Basic Law, allowing Merz's government to implement the most massive rearmament in Germany since World War II.


=== Ireland ===
In March 2025, Trump said that past American leaders "didn't have a clue what was happening and all of a sudden Ireland has our pharmaceutical companies", and "the United States shouldn't have let it happen"; the high number of American pharmaceutical companies based in Ireland were due to Irish tax policies.


=== Poland ===


=== Portugal ===

On March 14, 2025, Portugal's Defense Minister Nuno Melo stated that the country may opt for European jets over U.S. F-35s, citing concerns over President Donald Trump's unpredictable NATO stance and perceived pro-Russia shift. 


=== United Kingdom ===

In November 2024, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer offered his congratulations to Trump on a phone call after he won the 2024 US presidential election, along with other world leaders, saying "I look forward to working with you in the years ahead. I know that the UK-US special relationship will continue to prosper on both sides of the Atlantic for years to come."
Trump held a meeting with Starmer at the White House in February 2025, where Trump accepted King Charles III's request for Trump to go on a state visit to the UK. Starmer acknowledged Trump's historical ties and affection for the U.K., saying that "The United Kingdom and United States will work together to ensure the success of both our countries and deliver for people on both sides of the Atlantic."


=== Russia and Ukraine ===


==== Prologue ====

In January 2025, the Russo-Ukrainian War remains a protracted and attritional conflict, with frontlines largely static despite ongoing offensives. Russia maintains operational momentum, making incremental gains in the Donbas and southern Ukraine, but faces heavy losses in manpower and equipment. Ukraine, while resilient, faces growing logistical challenges, relying on dwindling Western military aid and precision strikes to counter Russian assaults. The war has evolved into high-intensity trench warfare, marked by drone technology, artillery duels, and attritional urban combat.
Ukraine's economy continues to function, sustained by foreign financial aid, while Russia's wartime economy remains stable despite international sanctions. Morale remains high among Ukrainian forces, though exhaustion is evident, while reports suggest growing Russian discontent among mobilized troops. The global impact of the war intensifies, with European nations increasing defense spending and China, Iran, and North Korea providing indirect support to Russia. With NATO stockpiles under strain and U.S. policy uncertain under the new Trump administration, the war's trajectory remains unclear. The Biden administration's policy of sustained military aid has ended, raising concerns over potential negotiations that could favor Moscow and shift the balance of power in Europe.


==== Initial Actions ====

On the Russo-Ukrainian War, Trump vowed that even before he was inaugurated, he would negotiate an end to the war in a day. He also vowed to stop the "endless flow of American treasure to Ukraine", and make Europeans reimburse the U.S. the cost of rebuilding its old stockpiles. However, critics have pointed out that most of the money set aside for Ukraine actually goes to American companies, factories and workers who make weapons and military equipment.
Retired lieutenant general Keith Kellogg and Frederick H. Fleitz, who both served in Trump's National Security Council staff, had presented Trump with a detailed peace plan to end Russia's war in Ukraine. The plan aims to force the two sides into peace talks and a ceasefire based on the current frontlines. If Ukraine refused to enter peace talks, weapons supplies would be stopped; if Russia refused peace talks, weapons supplies to Ukraine would be increased.
Following his victory, Trump warned that he would impose high tariffs and further sanctions on Russia if Vladimir Putin did not make a "deal" to end the war against Ukraine. Trump said he was "not looking to hurt Russia" and had "always had a very good relationship with President Putin," for whom he has expressed admiration.

Trump's presidency marked a reversal of Biden's policy towards Ukraine and the Russian invasion. On 12 February 2025, at the first meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group after Trump was inaugurated, new US Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said a return to Ukraine's pre-2014 borders was "an unrealistic objective" and that attempting to regain all territory "will only prolong the war". He said that Ukraine must have "robust security guarantees", but that the "United States does not believe that NATO membership for Ukraine is a realistic outcome of a negotiated settlement". The US expects Europe to provide more financial and military assistance for Ukraine, while the US concentrates on its own security. Hegseth said that no US troops would be deployed as peacekeepers to Ukraine.
Later that day Trump said he held a "highly productive phone call" with Russian President Putin agreed to "have our respective teams start negotiations immediately". They also agreed to visit each other's countries. Trump also held a phone call with president Zelenskyy, who said: "Together with the US, we are charting our next steps to stop Russian aggression and ensure a lasting, reliable peace".
Ukraine and its European allies were alarmed by Trump unilaterally opening negotiations with Putin and apparently giving concessions to Russia. Zelenskyy said that Ukraine would not accept an agreement made without it, while Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said: "Nothing can be discussed on Ukraine without Ukraine". John Bolton, Donald Trump's national security adviser during his first presidency, said: "Trump has effectively surrendered to Putin before the negotiations have even begun ... The positions that Defense Secretary Hegseth announced ... constitute terms of a settlement that could have been written in the Kremlin".
The following day, Hegseth seemed to backtrack on his remarks and said that "everything is on the table" for negotiations. On February 16, Marco Rubio stated that Ukraine and Europe would be part of any "real negotiations" to end the war. Trump said on the same day that Ukrainian President Zelenskyy "will be involved" in peace negotiations.

On February 18, 2025, American and Russian delegations, headed by Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, respectively, met in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, to develop a framework for further negotiations on ending Russia's war in Ukraine. Rubio was accompanied by U.S. National Security Advisor Michael Waltz and Special Envoy Steve Witkoff. Ukraine was not invited to the talks in Saudi Arabia.
According to Rubio, Trump wanted to know if Russia is serious about ending the war, and "the only way is to test them, to basically engage them and say, 'Okay, are you serious about ending the war? And if so, what are your demands? Are your public demands and your private demands different?'"
On February 27, 2025, Trump extended a series of sanctions against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine for one year.


==== Proposed Ukrainian minerals deal ====
It was reported on February 17, 2025, that the Trump administration had asked for the US to be given ownership of half of Ukraine's mineral and oil resources, as "payment" for US support. Several days earlier, Trump had said:"They [Ukraine] may make a deal. They may not make a deal. They may be Russian someday, or they may not be Russian someday. But I want this money back".
General terms and conditions of the agreement:

Ukraine has to give up 50% of its revenues from natural resources, including minerals, gas, oil, as well as revenues from ports, power plants and other infrastructure. The revenues should be directed to a fund in which the United States has 100% ownership. Ukraine should make contributions to the fund until it reaches $500 billion. The United States will have the right to receive revenues even from territories that Ukraine will liberate from Russian occupation in the future.
The agreement does not provide any security guarantees for Ukraine and military support for Ukraine, and aims only to return the non-refundable aid that Ukraine received from the United States during the Russian invasion. At the same time, the US has the right to reinvest part of the proceeds in Ukraine's post-war reconstruction if it is profitable for the US.
The Ukrainians did not sign the agreement. Although Zelenskyy had offered the US a stake in Ukraine's resources for continued support, he reportedly rejected the proposal. Zelenskyy said he was prepared to work on a "serious document" if it contained security guarantees, but said he could not "sell Ukraine away". According to The Telegraph, "Trump's demands would amount to a higher share of Ukrainian GDP than reparations imposed on Germany at the Versailles Treaty". On February 20, national security adviser Mike Waltz said that "Trump is obviously very frustrated" with Zelenskyy for not being "willing to take this opportunity that we have offered" with the minerals deal.
On February 23, 2025, President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy at a press conference at the forum "Ukraine. Year 2025" forum, thanked the United States for its assistance and appreciated Trump's interest in the investment agreement, but expressed doubts about its benefits for Ukraine and its content:

First, let's look at the figure [$500 billion]. I know that Ukraine received $100 billion [from the US]. And this is a fact. That's why I'm not going to recognize $500 billion, no matter what anyone says. With all due respect to my partners, I am standing firm because this is the true situation and we [Ukrainians] are absolutely right. Secondly, I am not ready to fix even $100 billion [in the agreement], because we should not recognize the grant [non-refundable aid] as a debt. Whether Trump likes it or not... A grant is not a debt.
The agreement was scheduled to be signed at 1pm (UTC−5) February 28, 2025 during a meeting at the White House, but after Trump and Vance got in a heated exchange with Zelensky on live television, the agreement was canceled.
American and European politicians point out that Trump lost the most lucrative deal of his life, which promised to bring the United States hundreds of billions of dollars, Zelenskyy lost a strategic security partner, and only Putin was the winner in this situation.


==== Attacks on Ukraine's leadership ====
On 18 February 2025, following the Riyadh meeting and Ukraine's rejection of the resources agreement, Trump seemingly blamed Ukraine for the Russian invasion. He said "You should have never started it. You could have made a deal". He said that Ukraine should have new presidential elections, falsely claiming that president Zelenskyy's approval ratings were only 4%. This echoed Kremlin claims that the Ukrainian leader was illegitimate. Zelenskyy replied that Trump was living in a Russian "disinformation bubble". Recent polls found that 57% of Ukrainians trusted Zelenskyy. The head of Ukraine's digital affairs ministry argued that Zelenskyy's ratings were actually 4–5% higher than Trump's. Ukraine's constitution forbids elections during martial law; all parties in Ukraine's parliament want to put off elections until after the war; and polls show that few Ukrainians want an election in the midst of an invasion.
On February 19, 2025, Trump wrote on social media that Zelenskyy was a "Dictator without Elections". Vice-president Vance warned Zelenskyy not to be "badmouthing" Trump. On February 21, Trump said that Zelenskyy had been negotiating "with no cards" regarding the Russia-Ukraine war "for three years, and nothing got done", so Trump said of Zelenskyy: "I don't think he's very important to be at meetings" regarding the Russia-Ukraine war.
Trump's February 19 comments were criticized by many US allies. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said that Zelenskyy is Ukraine's "democratically elected leader" and it is "perfectly reasonable" for Ukraine to "suspend elections during wartime as the UK did during World War Two". French President Emmanuel Macron said that Zelenskyy is Ukraine's "democratically elected leader." The French president added that this was "not the case for Vladimir Putin, who has been killing his opponents and manipulating his elections for a long time." German Chancellor Olaf Scholz called Trump's comments "false and dangerous". Australia's Defence Minister Richard Marles replied that "the aggressor here is Russia". UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric further pointed out that Trump's comments were incorrect. Several of Trump's fellow Republicans in Congress also disagreed that Zelenskyy was a dictator or that Ukraine bore responsibility for Russia's invasion. Another Trump ally, Reform UK leader Nigel Farage, disagreed with Trump's statements.
On February 21, Trump said that Russia attacked Ukraine, but blamed Zelenskyy and Biden for failing to prevent that. He further said that Zelenskyy and Putin should negotiate to prevent further killings of young soldiers and the deaths of "millions" of people.


==== 2025 Zelenskyy meeting ====

On February 28, 2025, Trump and Zelenskyy held a highly contentious, televised bilateral meeting in the Oval Office. The meeting abruptly ended without a clear resolution and without the expected signing of an agreement concerning Ukraine's rare earth minerals. Trump and Vance repeatedly criticized, made accusations, and raised their voices at Zelenskyy during the televised meeting. The incident marked the first time in U.S. history that a sitting president verbally attacked a visiting head of state on camera in such a manner.
Leading up to the meeting, there were tensions between the Trump administration, which wanted Ukraine to make concessions to Russia in order to swiftly end the war, and Zelenskyy's government, which distrusted Russia's commitment to abide by its agreements without U.S. security guarantee of Ukraine.
The meeting was widely characterized by its confrontational and antagonistic tone, drawing significant criticism from the media and the international community. Nearly all U.S. allies, along with other global figures, swiftly voiced their support for Zelenskyy following the confrontation, with many issuing statements that appeared to rebuke Trump's confrontational approach. In contrast, Russian officials praised the outcome of the meeting and directed criticism toward Zelenskyy. In the U.S., reactions were divided along partisan lines – members of Trump's party, the Republican Party, largely commended his conduct, while members of the Democratic Party widely condemned it. The meeting ended with Zelenskyy being asked to leave and a severance of negotiations. Three days after the meeting, the Trump administration suspended all military aid to Ukraine.


==== Suspension of U.S. support to Ukraine ====
On March 3, 2025, following the contentious February 28 meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, President Donald Trump ordered an indefinite pause on all U.S. military aid to Ukraine, citing dissatisfaction with Zelenskyy's commitment to peace negotiations with Russia. The decision impacts over $1 billion in arms and ammunition that had been slated for delivery to Ukraine. The White House stated that the pause was necessary to ensure that U.S. assistance was "contributing to a solution" rather than prolonging the conflict.  Critics argue it weakens Ukraine's defense, emboldens Russia, strains U.S. alliances, and worsens the humanitarian crisis.
On March 3, 2025, an anonymous but reportedly credible U.S. official claimed that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth ordered a pause on offensive cyberoperations against Russia by U.S. Cyber Command, scaling back efforts to counter digital threats from a key adversary. The decision, according to the U.S. official, does not impact cyberoperations by the CIA or the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency but follows other Trump administration rollbacks on cyber-related efforts at the FBI and other agencies. However, the Pentagon has since denied these claims, stating that no such order was given:

TO BE CLEAR: @SecDef has neither canceled nor delayed any cyber operations directed against malicious Russian targets and there has been no stand-down order whatsoever from that priority.
In response to the support and aid suspension, Zelenskyy expressed regret over the White House meeting, calling it "regrettable" and stating that it "did not go the way it was supposed to." He reaffirmed Ukraine's willingness to negotiate for peace and emphasized his desire for "constructive cooperation" with the United States. Zelenskyy also reiterated that Ukraine remains ready to sign a minerals deal with the U.S. "at any time and in any convenient format." The proposed deal would allocate half of all revenues from Ukraine's natural resources to a joint investment fund with the U.S., which Zelenskyy hoped would strengthen security guarantees and economic support for Ukraine.
On March 5, 2025, the U.S. paused intelligence-sharing with Ukraine, increasing pressure on President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to negotiate peace with Russia. CIA Director John Ratcliffe suggested the move was temporary, stating, "the pause I think will go away." The decision, following a halt in U.S. military aid, sparked criticism, warning it would cost Ukrainian lives.


==== U.S. resumes aid to Ukraine ====
On March 11, 2025, Ukraine agreed to a U.S.-proposed 30-day ceasefire with Russia, pending Moscow's acceptance. The announcement followed negotiations in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, where U.S. and Ukrainian officials reaffirmed their commitment to diplomacy. As part of the agreement, the Trump administration lifted its suspension of military aid and intelligence sharing with Ukraine. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio expressed hope that Russia would accept the ceasefire, stating, "The ball is now in their court." Ukrainian officials stressed the need for security guarantees to prevent future Russian invasions, warning that a temporary truce could allow Russia to reinforce its military position. Russian forces continue to occupy nearly one-fifth of Ukraine's territory.
In mid-March 2025, Russian President Vladimir Putin claimed a ceasefire would favor Ukraine and demanded Ukrainian forces in Kursk to surrender or die, then rejected an unconditional ceasefire after a call with President Trump, stalling negotiations.


==== US-Brokered Limited Ceasefire ====
In March 2025, the United States brokered a limited ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine, pausing strikes on Black Sea and energy infrastructure for 30 days starting March 18. Framed by the Trump administration as a pragmatic step to reduce escalation, critics argue the deal benefits Putin by protecting his oil refineries from Ukrainian drone attacks at a moment when those strikes are doing real damage, unlike Russia's Black Sea position, which is already lost, or its winter energy attacks, which are no longer relevant. Analysts believe Putin is using the pause to buy time, betting that the United States will gradually offer him more and more concessions. He likely sees Ukraine's Biden-era stockpiles running low and expects Trump will not replenish them at the same level, weakening Ukraine's long-term ability to fight.


== Middle East ==


=== Egypt ===

In February 2025, Donald Trump proposed that the United States take over the Gaza Strip after relocating all Palestinians to Egypt and Jordan. He threatens Egypt with cutting off American aid if the country refuses his plan. In March 2025, Egypt proposed its own plan to rebuild the Gaza Strip, involving the United Nations and the Palestinian Authority. The Egyptian plan is rejected by the Trump administration.


=== Iran and Iran-backed groups ===

By early 2025, Iran's regional influence significantly declined, after setbacks among its proxies and allies. Its proxies—Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Houthis—suffered major setbacks following the October 7 Hamas-led attack on Israel and the subsequent conflicts. The collapse of Bashar al-Assad's regime in Syria critically disrupted Iranian supply routes, severely impacting Hamas and Hezbollah. Russia, Iran's key ally, struggled to provide support as its prolonged war in Ukraine drained resources, further weakening the regional influence of the Iran-led axis.
During Trump's first term (2017–2021), the U.S. withdrew from the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) and imposed maximum-pressure sanctions, severely restricting Iran's oil exports and financial access. His administration sought to renegotiate the deal to impose stricter limits on Iran's nuclear program and curb its funding of regional proxies but failed to reach a new agreement. Under Biden (2021–2025), Iran's economy remained strained, though sanctions enforcement fluctuated. By early 2025, inflation soared, the currency collapsed, and domestic unrest intensified as Iran faced economic isolation while advancing its nuclear program.
Iran's uniquely weakened position now presents a rare opportunity for the United States to reshape the region. During his first term, Trump abandoned the JCPOA in hopes of forging a tougher deal that would impose stricter limits on Iran's nuclear program and its proxy funding—a move that ultimately failed. Many analysts argue that had the original deal remained intact, it could have paved the way for regional stability and a structured U.S. withdrawal, reducing America's long-term military footprint.  Now, with his second term just beginning, the stakes are high. If decisive steps are taken to secure a new comprehensive agreement, Iran's ambitions could be reined in, fostering stability and paving the way for an orderly exit of American forces. Conversely, without such bold action, there is a significant risk that U.S. troops could remain entrenched in the Middle East for decades to come.
Elon Musk met with Iran's UN Ambassador, Saeid Iravani, on November 11, 2024. And in January 2025 Elon Musk reportedly helped Italy's prime minister Giorgia Meloni secure the release of Italian citizen Cecila Sala from an Iranian prison.


==== Maximum pressure campaign ====
In February 2025, President Donald Trump signed a National Security Presidential Memorandum  reinstating the "maximum pressure" campaign against Iran, aiming to compel Tehran to negotiate a new nuclear agreement while preventing its development of nuclear weapons and countering its regional influence. The memorandum mandates heightened economic sanctions targeting Iran's oil exports, with the objective of reducing them to zero, and directs the revocation of existing sanctions waivers. Trump stated he would rather make a deal than take military action against Iran, framing the pressure campaign as a means to force diplomacy. This policy has led to significant economic challenges within Iran, including a sharp currency depreciation and political instability, as evidenced by the resignation of key officials such as Vice President Mohammad Javad Zarif and the impeachment of Economy Minister Abdolnaser Hemmati.  While proponents argue that these measures are necessary to curb Iran's nuclear ambitions and support for militant groups, critics contend that the campaign exacerbates humanitarian issues and regional tensions without effectively altering Iran's strategic behavior.
In March 2025, U.S. President Donald Trump confirmed that he sent a letter to Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, urging negotiations for a new nuclear agreement to replace the 2015 deal from which he withdrew in 2018. Emphasizing a preference for diplomacy, Trump warned of potential military action should negotiations fail. Iran officially responded to Trump's letter via Oman on March 26, rejecting direct talks under pressure but leaving the door open to indirect negotiations. Days later the U.S. deployed four B-2 Spirit stealth bombers to Diego Garcia—over 20% of the total B-2 fleet. Though officially aimed at deterring Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen, some analysts suggest the scale and capabilities of the deployment point to preparations for a potential strike on hardened Iranian nuclear targets like Fordow or Natanz, possibly in coordination with Israel.  On March 30, President Trump escalated pressure by threatening bombing “the likes of which [Iran has] never seen” and warning of secondary tariffs. The deployment and rhetoric are widely seen as part of a calculated pressure campaign to force Tehran back to the table, as Iran's uranium enrichment levels continue to exceed the limits set by the original 2015 accord.


==== Iran-backed Houthis in Yemen ====
On March 15, 2025, the U.S. launched airstrikes on Houthi targets in Yemen to counter attacks on Red Sea shipping. President Trump stated the strikes aimed to restore navigation freedom and deter further aggression. The Houthi-run health ministry reported 31 deaths and over 100 injuries. The Iran-backed group vowed to continue targeting vessels until Israel lifted its Gaza blockade. Trump warned of further action, urging Iran to withdraw support.
In March 2025, the Trump administration accidentally included The Atlantic editor Jeffrey Goldberg in a Signal group chat discussing classified military plans to strike Houthi targets in Yemen. The chat involved top officials including Vice President JD Vance and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. The leak, dubbed “Signalgate,” sparked bipartisan outrage and serious concerns over national security and operational discipline. President Trump dismissed the incident as a minor error, but critics called it a major intelligence failure.


=== Israel and Palestine ===


==== Ceasefire achieved ====
In his first term, Trump was considered one of the most pro-Israel presidents of the United States. During his 2024 presidential campaign, Trump urged Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu to end the war in Gaza within two months and opened the door to attacks on Iran's nuclear facilities. Trump warned Hamas that they would have "all hell to pay" if the war did not end before he took office in January. Following the election, Trump spoke with Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas for the first time since 2017. During their phone call, Trump expressed his desire to quickly end the war in Gaza.
Trump's son-in-law and former White House senior advisor Jared Kushner is expected to play a key role in the future United States' Middle East policy as an outside presidential adviser. Being pro-Israel and having ties with several Arab leaders, Kushner previously helped to broker the Abraham Accords during Trump's first presidency. Most of Trump's advisors and appointees are considered staunch supporters of the Jewish state, including Pete Hegseth, Mike Huckabee, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., John Ratcliffe, Marco Rubio, Elise Stefanik, and Michael Waltz. Lebanese-American businessman Massad Boulos, who was appointed as a senior advisor on Arab and Middle Eastern Affairs and has ties with Lebanese politicians, is viewed as an intermediary between Trump and Arab leaders. While Special Envoy for the Middle East Steve Witkoff is expected to deal with Israel, Boulos will help in negotiations with the Arab world.

Days before the inauguration of the administration, a ceasefire agreement was reached between Israel and Hamas. Trump and Biden both claimed credit for the ceasefire deal, with the former describing it as "EPIC". Several media sources, including Haaretz and The Times of Israel, credited Trump and Witkoff as responsible.
In early February 2025, after talks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, President Trump announced that the U.S. would “take over” and “own” the Gaza Strip, suggesting the forced relocation of Palestinians and its redevelopment. The proposal sparked international backlash, with the UN condemning it as ethnic cleansing, Arab nations rejecting it over regional stability concerns, and human rights groups calling it a war crime. Netanyahu praised the plan. Amid mounting pressure, Trump later stated that the U.S. would not enforce the takeover but would recommend it as a solution.


==== Collapse of the ceasefire ====
In March 2025, Israel, with Trump administration backing, launched airstrikes on Gaza, killing over 400 and ending a ceasefire. The strikes followed a dispute over hostage releases, with Israel demanding Hamas free half of the remaining hostages before extending the truce, while Hamas insisted on continuing negotiations. The White House confirmed Israel consulted Trump beforehand, and Trump warned of severe consequences for Hamas. In response, Yemen's Houthis launched missiles at Israel, which were intercepted, while the U.S. struck Houthi targets in Yemen.


=== Jordan ===

In February 2025, Donald Trump proposed that the United States take over the Gaza Strip after relocating all Palestinians to Jordan and Egypt. He threatens Jordan with cutting off American aid if the country refuses his plan.


=== Syria ===

In the Syrian civil war, the Syrian opposition launched an offensive against the pro-government Syrian Armed Forces in late November 2024, capturing the large cities of Aleppo and Hama. As opposition forces continued to close in on Damascus, President-elect Trump stated on December 7 that the U.S. should stay out of the conflict, stating "THIS IS NOT OUR FIGHT" in a social media post. Rebel groups captured Damascus the next day, December 8, as government forces surrendered and president Bashar al-Assad reportedly fled the country.
On January 30, 2025, the United States Central Command conducted an airstrike, killing senior Hurras al-Din operative Muhammad Salah al-Za'bir, inside Syria.
On March 9, 2025, Secretary of State Rubio condemned the massacres of Syrian minorities committed by pro-government fighters during clashes in western Syria in March 2025. He further indicated that "the United States stands with Syria's religious and ethnic minorities, including its Christian, Druze, Alawite, and Kurdish communities" and that the "perpetrators of these massacres against Syria's minority communities" should be held accountable.


== Multilateral Organizations and Policy ==

During his 2024 presidential campaign, Donald Trump emphasized an "America First" foreign policy, advocating for reduced U.S. involvement in international organizations and a reevaluation of global commitments. Building upon his first term's actions—such as withdrawing from the Paris Agreement and the World Health Organization—his second term is expected to further this agenda. Anticipated policies include reassessing NATO obligations, potentially imposing sanctions on the International Criminal Court, and significantly reducing foreign aid through agencies like USAID. These measures reflect a continued focus on national sovereignty and a departure from traditional multilateral engagements.
As one of his first acts as president, Trump withdrew the U.S. from the Paris Agreement and from the World Health Organization.
On January 24, 2025, Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced the United States had rejoined the Geneva Consensus Declaration.


=== USAID ===
In January 2025, the Trump administration announced a reduction of over 90% in the U.S. Agency for International Development’s (USAID) foreign aid contracts, as part of a broader $60 billion cut to U.S. foreign assistance programs. According to administration officials, the cuts were intended to reduce federal expenditures and redirect resources toward domestic priorities. Supporters argued that the move would help eliminate inefficiencies and reduce the risk of mismanagement in overseas assistance programs.
Critics, however, raised concerns that the reductions could weaken U.S. diplomatic engagement and global health initiatives. Some analysts noted that reducing foreign assistance might create strategic openings for rival powers such as China to expand their international influence.


=== ICC ===
On February 6, 2025, it was announced that Trump would sign an executive order that would sanction the International Criminal Court, that would reportedly accuse the ICC of improperly targeting US and Israeli individuals. It would include both financial sanctions and visa restrictions against an undetermined number of ICC officials and their families that would have assisted the ICC in investigating US citizens of allies.


=== NATO ===

Trump has repeatedly stated that he, as the president, would not commit to defending NATO member states that are not spending at least 2% of their GDP on defense. Additionally, Vice President-elect JD Vance has stated that in his view NATO is a "welfare client" and that it should be "a real alliance".


=== UN ===
In early 2025, Trump's administration significantly scaled back U.S. involvement with the United Nations, citing concerns about sovereignty, accountability, and alignment with American interests. The administration withdrew from key UN bodies, including the Human Rights Council and the UN climate damage fund, and halted all funding to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA), accusing the latter of anti-Israel bias and ties to Hamas.
Trump further distanced the U.S. from multilateral consensus by rejecting the UN's 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) on March 11, 2025, arguing they conflicted with U.S. sovereignty. These decisions triggered budget cuts affecting UN humanitarian efforts, notably the UN World Food Program, which subsequently reduced critical aid to Myanmar.
Additionally, the administration intensified scrutiny of UN humanitarian agencies, demanding disclosures of any ties to communism, socialism, or perceived anti-American ideologies. It also required clarification regarding their involvement in diversity, equity, inclusion, and climate initiatives.
In a significant shift reflecting Trump's emphasis on sovereignty and bilateral relations, the U.S. voted alongside nations such as North Korea and Syria against a February 24, 2025, UN General Assembly resolution condemning Russia's invasion of Ukraine. International criticism intensified, exemplified by Lord Soames of Fletching, who condemned Trump's alignment with Russia and questioned his commitment to traditional alliances.


== Trade Policy ==


=== Mar-a-Lago Accord ===
The term "Mar-a-Lago Accord" refers to an international agreement proposed by Stephen Miran before joining the Trump administration aimed at devaluing the U.S. dollar to address trade imbalances and enhance American economic competitiveness. Drawing parallels to the 1985 Plaza Accord, which successfully depreciated the dollar through coordinated efforts among major economies, the Mar-a-Lago Accord would envision a similar strategy to bolster U.S. manufacturing by making exports more competitive and reducing the trade deficit. The proposal includes measures such as restructuring U.S. debt by converting foreign-held Treasury securities into ultra-long-term bonds, thereby alleviating immediate fiscal pressures. Additionally, it suggests leveraging tariff policies to negotiate favorable currency valuations with key trading partners. While the concept has gained attention in financial circles, its feasibility remains a subject of debate among economists and policymakers trying to make sense of Trump's decisions.
It has been criticized as "QAnon for tariffs".


=== Tariff Implementations ===

On March 4, 2025, President Trump imposed tariffs on Canada (25% on imports, 10% on energy), Mexico (25% on imports), and China (increased tariffs from 10% to 20%). These measures aimed to pressure these countries to combat the production and distribution of fentanyl, addressing the U.S. opioid crisis. This led to a sharp decline in U.S. stock markets and warnings from retailers about rising consumer prices. In retaliation, Canada imposed 25% tariffs on $155 billion of U.S. goods, China placed 10-15% tariffs on U.S. agricultural products, and Mexico announced forthcoming countermeasures. These actions have escalated global trade tensions, affecting markets and economies worldwide.


== Expansionism ==

In the lead-up to his second inauguration, Trump proposed plans and ideas that would expand the United States' political influence and territory. The last territory acquired by the United States was in 1947 when the Mariana, Caroline, and Marshall Islands were acquired.


=== Canada ===

Trump has made repeated calls for Canada to become the 51st state of the United States. He initially raised this concept in a December 2024 summit with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and other Canadian government officials; the officials initially interpreted it as a joke. In January 2025, shortly before taking office, Trump continued this rhetoric, stating that he would use "economic force", but not military force, to annex Canada.
Trump made repeated allusions to the topic of Canadian annexation throughout his first month in office, and signed an executive order to impose blanket 25 percent tariffs on all Canadian imports. The executive order cited illegal border crossings and the fentanyl crisis as the reasons for the tariffs, though Canada is responsible for about 1.5 percent of illegal migrants and less than one percent of all fentanyl seized at the border. On Truth Social, Trump shared  his disapproval of the U.S. trade deficit with Canada. When asked by a reporter what Canada could do to avoid the tariffs, he again raised the idea of the U.S. annexing the nation as its 51st state.
Canada promised more than $150 billion CAD in retaliatory tariffs, and provincial responses included Ontario proposing billions of dollars in tax deferrals and payouts to stem the economic fallout from the blanket tariffs. Shortly before they were set to take effect, Trump reached an agreement with Trudeau to temporarily delay his blanket tariffs for 30 days. Shortly afterward, he made plans to impose steel and aluminum tariffs with significant impacts on Canada.
Afterward, Trump continued to insist that Canada could become the 51st state. In an interview preceding Super Bowl LIX, Fox News journalist Bret Baier asked Trump if he was serious about his proposals to make Canada a U.S. state; Trump said that he was indeed serious. Trudeau was caught in a private meeting imploring private-sector leaders to take Trump's annexation threats seriously.
Polling showed that the vast majority of Canadians opposed the idea of joining the U.S. Canadian flag sales increased in the early months of 2025, and Ontario premier Doug Ford helped popularize a "Canada Is Not For Sale" baseball cap resembling Trump's famous Make America Great Again caps. In February, all 13 Canadian premiers visited Washington, D.C. together to argue for the permanent postponement of the tariff plans.


=== Greenland ===

In December 2024, Trump stated a further proposal for the United States to purchase Greenland from Denmark, describing ownership and control of the island as "an absolute necessity" for national security purposes. This builds upon a prior offer from Trump to buy Greenland during his first term, which the Danish Realm refused, causing him to cancel his August 2019 visit to Denmark. On January 7, 2025, Trump's son Donald Trump Jr. visited Greenland's capital city Nuuk alongside Charlie Kirk to hand out MAGA hats. At a press conference the following day, Trump refused to rule out military or economic force to take over Greenland or the Panama Canal. However, he did rule out military force in taking over Canada. On January 14, the Trump-affiliated Nelk Boys also visited Nuuk, handing out dollar bills to locals. On January 16, the CEOs of major Danish companies Novo Nordisk, Vestas and Carlsberg among others were assembled for a crisis meeting in the Ministry of State to discuss the situation. On the subsequent day, former chief executive Friis Arne Petersen in the Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs described the situation as "historically unheard of", while Noa Redington, special adviser to former prime minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt, compared the international pressure on Denmark with that during the 2005 Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy.

In March 2025, President Trump renewed calls to annex Greenland, calling it vital to U.S. and global security. Vice President JD Vance, during a visit to the Pituffik Space Base, accused Denmark of underinvesting in Greenland's defense and encouraged a shift toward U.S. partnership. Denmark's foreign minister condemned the administration's tone, while Trump said he preferred diplomacy but would not rule out military action. Greenlandic leaders rejected the annexation effort, formed a coalition government to oppose it, and protests erupted in Copenhagen. U.S. House Democrats introduced a bill to block the use of force, and NATO clarified it would not support any territorial acquisition.


=== Panama Canal ===
In 2024, Trump demanded that Panama return control of the Panama Canal to the United States due to "excessive rates" being charged for American passage. The United States previously was in control of the Panama Canal Zone from 1903 until 1999, and has invaded Panama before in 1989.
In March 2025, a consortium led by BlackRock acquired a majority stake in CK Hutchison Holdings' port operations, including the ports of Balboa and Cristobal at the Panama Canal, for $22.8 billion. Trump praised the acquisition, suggesting it marked progress in "reclaiming the Panama Canal."  Panama's government, however, emphasized continued Panamanian sovereignty over the canal and its administration.


=== Gaza ===

In February 2025, Trump said that the United States "will take over Gaza", sending troops "if necessary". During a joint press conference with Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Trump proposed that the US government "take over" Gaza, force all two million of its Palestinian residents into neighboring countries, and develop it into a "Riviera of the Middle East". To do so, Trump did not rule out using the American military. António Guterres, Secretrary-General of the UN, criticized the plan, labelling it "ethnic cleansing". A few days after his comments about taking over Gaza, Trump stated that Israel would hand over Gaza to the US after the fighting was ended and the Gazan population was resettled elsewhere, which would negate the need for US troops in Gaza. Trump's proposal to resettle Palestinians from Gaza was supported by Netanyahu, Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz, Israeli opposition leader Yair Lapid, and the majority of the Israeli public. Trump subsequently said that Palestinians resettled from Gaza as part of this plan would not be allowed to return there.
On February 21, 2025, after opposition from Arab states, Trump said he would "recommend" — but was "not forcing" — his plan for the US takeover of Gaza and the resettlement of the Palestinian population.
