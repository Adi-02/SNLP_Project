From the total of 5,086 stars known to have exoplanets (as of January 26, 2024), there are a total of 1,033 known multiplanetary systems, or stars with at least two confirmed planets, beyond the Solar System. This list includes systems with at least three confirmed planets or two confirmed planets where additional candidates have been proposed. The stars with the most confirmed planets are the Sun (the Solar System's star) and Kepler-90, with 8 confirmed planets each, followed by TRAPPIST-1 with 7 planets.
The 1,033 multiplanetary systems are listed below according to the star's distance from Earth. Proxima Centauri, the closest star to the Solar System, has at least one confirmed planet (b, along with the candidate d and the disputed c). The nearest system with four or more confirmed planets is Barnard Star, with four known. The farthest confirmed multiplanetary system is OGLE-2012-BLG-0026L, at 13,300 light-years (4,100 pc) away.
The table below contains information about the coordinates, spectral and physical properties, and the number of confirmed (unconfirmed) planets for systems with at least 2 planets and 1 not confirmed. The two most important stellar properties are mass and metallicity because they determine how these planetary systems form. Systems with higher mass and metallicity tend to have more planets and more massive planets. However, although low metallicity stars tend to have fewer massive planets, particularly hot-Jupiters, they also tend to have a larger number of close-in planets, orbiting at less than 1 AU.
