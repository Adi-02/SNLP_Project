== Timeline of highest-grossing films ==
Up until the 1980s, the Chinese box office was typically reported in terms of box office admissions (ticket sales), rather than gross revenue. The film with the highest ticket sales in China is Legend of the White Snake (1980) with an estimated 700 million admissions, followed by In-Laws (Full House of Joy) with 650 million ticket sales. The foreign film with the highest ticket sales in China was the 1976 Japanese film Kimi yo Fundo no Kawa o Watare (Manhunt), which had its Chinese release in 1978 and sold more than 330 million tickets in China, followed by the Indian film Caravan (1971) which had its Chinese release in 1979 and sold about 300 million tickets in China. Hollywood film releases were relatively rare in China up until First Blood (1982), which had its Chinese release in 1985, and went on to sell 76 million tickets, the highest for a Hollywood film in China up until 2018.
Zhou Enlai was released in 1992 and became China's highest-grossing film with CN¥270 million. China began releasing box office gross revenue results for foreign non-Chinese films in November 1994, upon the release of The Fugitive (1993). In 1995, the Hong Kong action film Rumble in the Bronx, directed by Stanley Tong and starring Jackie Chan, became the all-time highest-grossing foreign film in China, where it grossed CN¥110 million; it is not considered a domestic film as it was produced in Hong Kong (then a British Dependent Territory). It was above the year's highest domestic Chinese film, Jiang Wen's In the Heat of the Sun with ¥50 million. Stanley Tong and Jackie Chan surpassed their own record with the Hong Kong action film Police Story 4: First Strike (1996), which grossed CN¥112 million in China. In 1998, Titanic (directed by James Cameron) became the all-time highest-grossing film to be released in China, with a then-unprecedented ¥360 million. In 2002, Hero became the second highest-grossing domestic film, with CN¥250 million. China's first domestic film to breach ¥360 million was released in 2009, The Founding of a Republic. In 2015, Monster Hunt became the first domestic film in 17 years to become the overall highest-grossing film in China, earning ¥2.44 billion.
