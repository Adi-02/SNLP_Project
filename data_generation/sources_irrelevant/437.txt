The Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture â€“ Drama is a Golden Globe Award that has been awarded annually since 1944 by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association (HFPA). Since its institution in 1943, the Hollywood Foreign Press Association is an organization of journalists who cover the film industry in the United States, but are affiliated with publications outside North America.
When the awards were introduced, there was a single category for Best Picture. Starting with the 9th Golden Globe Awards, the Golden Globes split the Acting and Best Picture awards into Drama and Musical or Comedy categories. Since 1951, the only time the awards were reunified was in 1953.
This award goes to the producers of the film. In the following lists, the first titles listed are winners. These are also in bold and in blue background; those not in bold are nominees.
The years given are those in which the films under consideration were released, not the year of the ceremony, which always takes place the following year.

== Notes ==
Following the controversy over the motion picture category omission towards non-English language films, The Zone of Interest (United Kingdom) is the first wholly non-English language film to be nominated both Foreign Language and in this category, although Anatomy of a Fall (France) is part of non-English language film due to occasional use of English language.
